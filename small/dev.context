new sequencing technologies , such as massive parallel sequencing have also opened up the prospect of personal genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool , as pioneered by manteia predictive medicine . a major step toward that goal was the completion in 2007 of the full genome of james d. watson , one of the co-discoverers of the structure of dna .
partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhoea . another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world . this in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs , a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the arab spring . poor operation of facilities , such as water and wastewater treatment plants , as well as limited government accountability and transparency , are also issues .
the mosaics of the villa romana del casale near piazza armerina in sicily are the largest collection of late roman mosaics in situ in the world , and are protected as a unesco world heritage site . the large villa rustica , which was probably owned by emperor maximian , was built largely in the early 4th century . the mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th century . the most important pieces are the circus scene , the 64m long great hunting scene , the little hunt , the labours of hercules and the famous bikini girls , showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th century bikinis . the peristyle , the imperial apartments and the thermae were also decorated with ornamental and mythological mosaics . other important examples of roman mosaic art in sicily were unearthed on the piazza vittoria in palermo where two houses were discovered . the most important scenes there depicted orpheus , alexander the great 's hunt and the four seasons .
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the paleolithic and the neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . [ citation needed ] further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . [ citation needed ] anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . by making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time-based ) and cultural regions ( space-based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science .
beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s , architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism , with architects like charles moore in the usa , christian norberg-schulz in norway , and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy , who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents . postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials , with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles , from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles . robert venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a " decorated shed " ( an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside ) , and upheld it against modernist and brutalist " ducks " ( buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms ) .
the monogram theme was developed into an art deco-style badge on which the letters a and c framed a football rather than the letter f , the whole set within a hexagonal border . this early example of a corporate logo , introduced as part of herbert chapman 's rebranding of the club in the 1930s , was used not only on cup final shirts but as a design feature throughout highbury stadium , including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors . from 1967 , a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts , until replaced by the club crest , sometimes with the addition of the nickname " the gunners " , in the 1990s .
in 1877 , thomas edison invented the phonograph . unlike the phonautograph , it was capable of both recording and reproducing sound . despite the similarity of name , there is no documentary evidence that edison 's phonograph was based on scott 's phonautograph . edison first tried recording sound on a wax-impregnated paper tape , with the idea of creating a " telephone repeater " analogous to the telegraph repeater he had been working on . although the visible results made him confident that sound could be physically recorded and reproduced , his notes do not indicate that he actually reproduced sound before his first experiment in which he used tinfoil as a recording medium several months later . the tinfoil was wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder and a sound-vibrated stylus indented the tinfoil while the cylinder was rotated . the recording could be played back immediately . the scientific american article that introduced the tinfoil phonograph to the public mentioned marey , rosapelly and barlow as well as scott as creators of devices for recording but , importantly , not reproducing sound . edison also invented variations of the phonograph that used tape and disc formats . numerous applications for the phonograph were envisioned , but although it enjoyed a brief vogue as a startling novelty at public demonstrations , the tinfoil phonograph proved too crude to be put to any practical use . a decade later , edison developed a greatly improved phonograph that used a hollow wax cylinder instead of a foil sheet . this proved to be both a better-sounding and far more useful and durable device . the wax phonograph cylinder created the recorded sound market at the end of the 1880s and dominated it through the early years of the 20th century .
though pesticide regulations differ from country to country , pesticides , and products on which they were used are traded across international borders . to deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries , delegates to a conference of the united nations food and agriculture organization adopted an international code of conduct on the distribution and use of pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries . the code was updated in 1998 and 2002 . the fao claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use .
according to the federal bureau of investigation 's uniform crime reports , in 2010 the raleigh police department and other agencies in the city reported 1,740 incidents of violent crime and 12,995 incidents of property crime – far below both the national average and the north carolina average . of the violent crimes reported , 14 were murders , 99 were forcible rapes and 643 were robberies . aggravated assault accounted for 984 of the total violent crimes . property crimes included burglaries which accounted for 3,021 , larcenies for 9,104 and arson for 63 of the total number of incidents . motor vehicle theft accounted for 870 incidents out of the total .
an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall-plug efficiency , meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy , usually measured in lumen per watt . a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the " bulb " to the surroundings . the more transparent the lighting fixture is , the higher efficacy . shading the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability .
a great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale . great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence , which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers ' opinions before taking actions of their own . international relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities , spatial aspects , and status dimensions . sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the congress of vienna or an international structure such as the united nations security council ( china , france , russia , the united kingdom and the united states serve as the body 's five permanent members ) . at the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the g7 which consists of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom and the united states of america .
protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom . freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological , philosophical , and political agendas since luther refused to recant his beliefs before the diet of the holy roman empire at worms ( 1521 ) . in his view , faith was a free work of the holy spirit and could , therefore , not be forced on a person . the persecuted anabaptists and huguenots demanded freedom of conscience , and they practised separation of church and state . in the early seventeenth century , baptists like john smyth and thomas helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom . their thinking influenced john milton and john locke 's stance on tolerance . under the leadership of baptist roger williams , congregationalist thomas hooker , and quaker william penn , respectively , rhode island , connecticut , and pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion . these colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities , including jews . the united states declaration of independence , the united states constitution , and the american bill of rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework . the great majority of american protestants , both clergy and laity , strongly supported the independence movement . all major protestant churches were represented in the first and second continental congresses . in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the american democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world ( e.g. , latin america , japan , and germany ) . the strongest link between the american and french revolutions was marquis de lafayette , an ardent supporter of the american constitutional principles . the french declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen was mainly based on lafayette 's draft of this document . the united nations declaration and universal declaration of human rights also echo the american constitutional tradition .
executives at trump entertainment resorts , whose sole remaining property will be the trump taj mahal , said in 2013 that they were considering the option of selling the taj and winding down and exiting the gaming and hotel business .
on 17 march 1883 , she fell down some stairs at windsor , which left her lame until july ; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter . brown died 10 days after her accident , and to the consternation of her private secretary , sir henry ponsonby , victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of brown . ponsonby and randall davidson , dean of windsor , who had both seen early drafts , advised victoria against publication , on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair . the manuscript was destroyed . in early 1884 , victoria did publish more leaves from a journal of a life in the highlands , a sequel to her earlier book , which she dedicated to her " devoted personal attendant and faithful friend john brown " . on the day after the first anniversary of brown 's death , victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son , leopold , had died in cannes . he was " the dearest of my dear sons " , she lamented . the following month , victoria 's youngest child , beatrice , met and fell in love with prince henry of battenberg at the wedding of victoria 's granddaughter princess victoria of hesse and by rhine to henry 's brother prince louis of battenberg . beatrice and henry planned to marry , but victoria opposed the match at first , wishing to keep beatrice at home to act as her companion . after a year , she was won around to the marriage by henry and beatrice 's promise to remain living with and attending her .
in australia , nonprofit organisations include trade unions , charitable entities , co-operatives , universities and hospitals , mutual societies , grass-root and support groups , political parties , religious groups , incorporated associations , not-for-profit companies , trusts and more . furthermore , they operate across a multitude of domains and industries , from health , employment , disability and other human services to local sporting clubs , credit unions and research institutes . a nonprofit organisation in australia can choose from a number of legal forms depending on the needs and activities of the organisation : co-operative , company limited by guarantee , unincorporated association , incorporated association ( by the associations incorporation act 1985 ) or incorporated association or council ( by the commonwealth aboriginal councils and associations act 1976 ) . from an academic perspective , social enterprise is for the most part considered a sub-set of the nonprofit sector as typically they too are concerned with a purpose relating to a public good , however these are not bound to adhere to a nonprofit legal structure and many incorporate and operate as for-profit entities .
among predators there is a large degree of specialization . many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey . others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything ( examples : humans , leopards , dogs and alligators ) . the specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey . the prey in turn , are often equally suited to escape that predator . this is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium . some predators specialize in certain classes of prey , not just single species . some will switch to other prey ( with varying degrees of success ) when the preferred target is extremely scarce , and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible .

in han government , the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver , the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations ; those who earned a 600-dan salary-rank or higher . theoretically , there were no limits to his power . however , state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference ( tingyi 廷議 ) —where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions . if the emperor rejected a court conference decision , he risked alienating his high ministers . nevertheless , emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences .
in the mahayana , the buddha tends not to be viewed as merely human , but as the earthly projection of a beginningless and endless , omnipresent being ( see dharmakaya ) beyond the range and reach of thought . moreover , in certain mahayana sutras , the buddha , dharma and sangha are viewed essentially as one : all three are seen as the eternal buddha himself .
against the rested and re-armed pusan perimeter defenders and their reinforcements , the kpa were undermanned and poorly supplied ; unlike the un command , they lacked naval and air support . to relieve the pusan perimeter , general macarthur recommended an amphibious landing at inchon ( now known as incheon ) , near seoul and well over 100 miles ( 160 km ) behind the kpa lines . on 6 july , he ordered major general hobart r. gay , commander , 1st cavalry division , to plan the division 's amphibious landing at incheon ; on 12–14 july , the 1st cavalry division embarked from yokohama , japan to reinforce the 24th infantry division inside the pusan perimeter .
most historians today , including john 's recent biographers ralph turner and lewis warren , argue that john was an unsuccessful monarch , but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers . jim bradbury notes the current consensus that john was a " hard-working administrator , an able man , an able general " , albeit , as turner suggests , with " distasteful , even dangerous personality traits " , including pettiness , spitefulness and cruelty . john gillingham , author of a major biography of richard i , follows this line too , although he considers john a less effective general than do turner or warren , and describes him " one of the worst kings ever to rule england " . bradbury takes a moderate line , but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards john 's numerous faults . popular historian frank mclynn maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on john , arguing that the king 's modern reputation amongst historians is " bizarre " , and that as a monarch john " fails almost all those [ tests ] that can be legitimately set " .
generally , american civil procedure has several notable features , including extensive pretrial discovery , heavy reliance on live testimony obtained at deposition or elicited in front of a jury , and aggressive pretrial " law and motion " practice designed to result in a pretrial disposition ( that is , summary judgment ) or a settlement . u.s. courts pioneered the concept of the opt-out class action , by which the burden falls on class members to notify the court that they do not wish to be bound by the judgment , as opposed to opt-in class actions , where class members must join into the class . another unique feature is the so-called american rule under which parties generally bear their own attorneys ' fees ( as opposed to the english rule of " loser pays " ) , though american legislators and courts have carved out numerous exceptions .
the early western han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of legalism , huang-lao daoism , and confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy . however , the han court under emperor wu gave confucianism exclusive patronage . he abolished all academic chairs or erudites ( bóshì 博士 ) not dealing with the confucian five classics in 136 bc and encouraged nominees for office to receive a confucian-based education at the imperial university that he established in 124 bc . unlike the original ideology espoused by confucius , or kongzi ( 551–479 bc ) , han confucianism in emperor wu 's reign was the creation of dong zhongshu ( 179–104 bc ) . dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical confucian ideas of ritual , filial piety , and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin-yang cosmologies . much to the interest of the ruler , dong 's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe . the imperial university grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30,000 by the 2nd century ad . a confucian-based education was also made available at commandery-level schools and private schools opened in small towns , where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments .
white leds can also be made by coating near-ultraviolet ( nuv ) leds with a mixture of high-efficiency europium-based phosphors that emit red and blue , plus copper and aluminium-doped zinc sulfide ( zns : cu , al ) that emits green . this is a method analogous to the way fluorescent lamps work . this method is less efficient than blue leds with yag : ce phosphor , as the stokes shift is larger , so more energy is converted to heat , but yields light with better spectral characteristics , which render color better . due to the higher radiative output of the ultraviolet leds than of the blue ones , both methods offer comparable brightness . a concern is that uv light may leak from a malfunctioning light source and cause harm to human eyes or skin .
the principles of phonological analysis can be applied independently of modality because they are designed to serve as general analytical tools , not language-specific ones . the same principles have been applied to the analysis of sign languages ( see phonemes in sign languages ) , even though the sub-lexical units are not instantiated as speech sounds .
a series of international crises strained the league to its limits , the earliest being the invasion of manchuria by japan and the abyssinian crisis of 1935/36 in which italy invaded abyssinia , one of the only free african nations at that time . the league tried to enforce economic sanctions upon italy , but to no avail . the incident highlighted french and british weakness , exemplified by their reluctance to alienate italy and lose her as their ally . the limited actions taken by the western powers pushed mussolini 's italy towards alliance with hitler 's germany anyway . the abyssinian war showed hitler how weak the league was and encouraged the remilitarization of the rhineland in flagrant disregard of the treaty of versailles . this was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the invasion of poland in september 1939 and the beginning of the second world war .
during the war , the paris national guard , particularly in the working-class neighbourhoods of paris , had become highly politicised and units elected officers ; many refused to wear uniforms or obey commands from the national government . national guard units tried to seize power in paris on 31 october 1870 and 22 january 1871 . on 18 march 1871 , when the regular army tried to remove cannons from an artillery park on montmartre , national guard units resisted and killed two army generals . the national government and regular army forces retreated to versailles and a revolutionary government was proclaimed in paris . a commune was elected , which was dominated by socialists , anarchists and revolutionaries . the red flag replaced the french tricolour and a civil war began between the commune and the regular army , which attacked and recaptured paris from 21–28 may in la semaine sanglante ( bloody week ) .
the subsequent 2005 elections were internationally regarded as the most free and fair in liberian history . ellen johnson sirleaf , a harvard-trained economist and former minister of finance , was elected as the first female president in africa . upon her inauguration , sirleaf requested the extradition of taylor from nigeria and transferred him to the scsl for trial in the hague . in 2006 , the government established a truth and reconciliation commission to address the causes and crimes of the civil war .
during the 19th century , an important producer of art was the academia de san carlos ( san carlos art academy ) , founded during colonial times , and which later became the escuela nacional de artes plásticas ( the national school of arts ) including painting , sculpture and graphic design , one of unam 's art schools . many of the works produced by the students and faculty of that time are now displayed in the museo nacional de san carlos ( national museum of san carlos ) . one of the students , josé maría velasco , is considered one of the greatest mexican landscape painters of the 19th century . porfirio díaz 's regime sponsored arts , especially those that followed the french school . popular arts in the form of cartoons and illustrations flourished , e.g . those of josé guadalupe posada and manuel manilla . the permanent collection of the san carlos museum also includes paintings by european masters such as rembrandt , velázquez , murillo , and rubens .
dannatt criticised a remnant " cold war mentality " , with military expenditures based on retaining a capability against a direct conventional strategic threat ; he said currently only 10 % of the mod 's equipment programme budget between 2003 and 2018 was to be invested in the " land environment " —at a time when britain was engaged in land-based wars in afghanistan and iraq .
arsenal appointed herbert chapman as manager in 1925 . having already won the league twice with huddersfield town in 1923–24 and 1924–25 ( see seasons in english football ) , chapman brought arsenal their first period of major success . his revolutionary tactics and training , along with the signings of star players such as alex james and cliff bastin , laid the foundations of the club 's domination of english football in the 1930s . under his guidance arsenal won their first major trophies – victory in the 1930 fa cup final preceded two league championships , in 1930–31 and 1932–33 . in addition , chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local london underground station from " gillespie road " to " arsenal " , making it the only tube station to be named specifically after a football club .

in the 1940s , detroit blues artist john lee hooker became a long-term resident in the city 's southwest delray neighborhood . hooker , among other important blues musicians migrated from his home in mississippi bringing the delta blues to northern cities like detroit . hooker recorded for fortune records , the biggest pre-motown blues/soul label . during the 1950s , the city became a center for jazz , with stars performing in the black bottom neighborhood . prominent emerging jazz musicians of the 1960s included : trumpet player donald byrd who attended cass tech and performed with art blakey and the jazz messengers early in his career and saxophonist pepper adams who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied byrd on several albums . the graystone international jazz museum documents jazz in detroit .
in the mid 1970s , various american groups ( some with ties to downtown manhattan 's punk scene , including television and suicide ) had begun expanding on the vocabulary of punk music . midwestern groups such as pere ubu and devo drew inspiration from the region 's derelict industrial environments , employing conceptual art techniques , musique concrète and unconventional verbal styles that would presage the post-punk movement by several years . a variety of subsequent groups , including new york-based talking heads and boston-based mission of burma , combined elements of punk with art school sensibilities . in 1978 , the former band began a series of collaborations with british ambient pioneer and ex-roxy music member brian eno , experimenting with dada-influenced lyrical techniques , dance music , and african polyrhythms . san francisco 's vibrant post-punk scene was centered around such groups as chrome , the residents and tuxedomoon , who incorporated multimedia experimentation , film and ideas from antonin artaud 's theater of cruelty .
as reflected in the 2010 united states census , alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places ( cdps ) . the tally of cities includes four unified municipalities , essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county . the majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as " the bush " and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network . the table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in alaska , in population order .
on 5 march , nasser 's security coterie arrested thousands of participants in the uprising . as a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order , the rcc decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the free officers ' withdrawal from politics . the rcc succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution , namely the workers , peasants , and petty bourgeois , to oppose the decrees , with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering cairo in protest in late march . naguib sought to crackdown on the protesters , but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces . on 29 march , nasser announced the decrees ' revocation in response to the " impulse of the street . " between april and june , hundreds of naguib 's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed , and mohieddin was informally exiled to switzerland to represent the rcc abroad . king saud of saudi arabia attempted to mend relations between nasser and naguib , but to no avail .
temperatures below 0 °c ( 32 °f ) or above 25 °c ( 77 °f ) are rare . cork airport records an average of 1,227.9 millimetres ( 4.029 ft ) of precipitation annually , most of which is rain . the airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year ; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year . the low altitude of the city , and moderating influences of the harbour , mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself . there are on average 204 " rainy " days a year ( over 0.2 millimetres ( 0.0079 in ) of rainfall ) , of which there are 73 days with " heavy rain " ( over 5 millimetres ( 0.20 in ) ) . cork is also a generally foggy city , with an average of 97 days of fog a year , most common during mornings and during winter . despite this , however , cork is also one of ireland 's sunniest cities , with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no " recordable sunshine " , mostly during and around winter .
the terms piracy and theft are often associated with copyright infringement . the original meaning of piracy is " robbery or illegal violence at sea " , but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement . theft , meanwhile , emphasizes the potential commercial harm of infringement to copyright holders . however , copyright is a type of intellectual property , an area of law distinct from that which covers robbery or theft , offenses related only to tangible property . not all copyright infringement results in commercial loss , and the u.s. supreme court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not easily equate with theft .

since ancient times , north zhejiang and neighbouring south jiangsu have been famed for their prosperity and opulence [ citation needed ] , and simply inserting north zhejiang place names ( hangzhou , jiaxing , etc . ) into poetry gave an effect of dreaminess , a practice followed by many noted poets . in particular , the fame of hangzhou ( as well as suzhou in neighbouring jiangsu province ) has led to the popular saying : " above there is heaven ; below there is suzhou and hangzhou " ( 上有天堂，下有苏杭 ) , a saying that continues to be a source of pride for the people of these two still prosperous cities .
purebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds , but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic . systematic analyses of the dog genome has revealed only four major types of dogs that can be said to be statistically distinct . these include the " old world dogs " ( e.g. , malamute and shar pei ) , " mastiff " -type ( e.g. , english mastiff ) , " herding " -type ( e.g. , border collie ) , and " all others " ( also called " modern " - or " hunting " -type ) .

popular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of mary 's conception . in 1439 , the council of basel , which is not reckoned an ecumenical council , stated that belief in the immaculate conception of mary is in accord with the catholic faith . by the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties , but such was the influence of the dominicans , and the weight of the arguments of thomas aquinas ( who had been canonised in 1323 and declared " doctor angelicus " of the church in 1567 ) that the council of trent ( 1545–63 ) —which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine—instead declined to take a position .
in the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals . bacteria such as mycobacterium leprae and treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary . viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals . some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs . another useful identification method is xenodiagnosis , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent . chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis . in this case , xenodiagnosis involves the use of the vector of the chagas agent t. cruzi , an uninfected triatomine bug , which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected . the bug is later inspected for growth of t. cruzi within its gut .
baptists have faced many controversies in their 400-year history , controversies of the level of crises . baptist historian walter shurden says the word " crisis " comes from the greek word meaning " to decide . " shurden writes that contrary to the presumed negative view of crises , some controversies that reach a crisis level may actually be " positive and highly productive . " he claims that even schism , though never ideal , has often produced positive results . in his opinion crises among baptists each have become decision-moments that shaped their future . some controversies that have shaped baptists include the " missions crisis " , the " slavery crisis " , the " landmark crisis " , and the " modernist crisis " .

whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory . this has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events ( as opposed to static things ) within organizations through an “ organization studies ” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak ' and 'strong ' process perspectives from a number of philosophers . one of the leading figures having an explicitly whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is mark dibben , who works in what he calls " applied process thought " to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics . for dibben , this allows " a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing , as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening . " dibben has published two books on applied process thought , applied process thought i : initial explorations in theory and research ( 2008 ) , and applied process thought ii : following a trail ablaze ( 2009 ) , as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics .
a similar struggle began in india when the government of india act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence . concerns over communist and foreign plots following the ghadar conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the rowlatt acts . this led to tension , particularly in the punjab region , where repressive measures culminated in the amritsar massacre . in britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the event , between those who saw it as having saved india from anarchy , and those who viewed it with revulsion . the subsequent non-co-operation movement was called off in march 1922 following the chauri chaura incident , and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years .

in 1869 the suez canal opened under napoleon iii , linking the mediterranean with the indian ocean . initially the canal was opposed by the british ; but once opened , its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the " jugular vein of the empire " . in 1875 , the conservative government of benjamin disraeli bought the indebted egyptian ruler isma'il pasha 's 44 percent shareholding in the suez canal for £4 million ( £340 million in 2013 ) . although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway , it did give britain leverage . joint anglo-french financial control over egypt ended in outright british occupation in 1882 . the french were still majority shareholders and attempted to weaken the british position , but a compromise was reached with the 1888 convention of constantinople , which made the canal officially neutral territory .

the u.s. navy , by contrast , relied on commerce raiding from the outset . however , the problem of allied forces surrounded in the philippines , during the early part of 1942 , led to diversion of boats to " guerrilla submarine " missions . as well , basing in australia placed boats under japanese aerial threat while en route to patrol areas , reducing their effectiveness , and nimitz relied on submarines for close surveillance of enemy bases . furthermore , the standard-issue mark 14 torpedo and its mark vi exploder both proved defective , problems which were not corrected until september 1943 . worst of all , before the war , an uninformed us customs officer had seized a copy of the japanese merchant marine code ( called the " maru code " in the usn ) , not knowing that the office of naval intelligence ( oni ) had broken it . the japanese promptly changed it , and the new code was not broken again by op-20g until 1943 .

shemaryahu talmon , who summarized the amount of consensus and genetic relation to the urtext of the hebrew bible , concluded that major divergences which intrinsically affect the sense are extremely rare . as far as the hebrew bible referenced by old testament is concerned , almost all of the textual variants are fairly insignificant and hardly affect any doctrine . professor douglas stuart states : " it is fair to say that the verses , chapters , and books of the bible would read largely the same , and would leave the same impression with the reader , even if one adopted virtually every possible alternative reading to those now serving as the basis for current english translations . "
large brushes are desired for a larger brush contact area to maximize motor output , but small brushes are desired for low mass to maximize the speed at which the motor can run without the brushes excessively bouncing and sparking . ( small brushes are also desirable for lower cost . ) stiffer brush springs can also be used to make brushes of a given mass work at a higher speed , but at the cost of greater friction losses ( lower efficiency ) and accelerated brush and commutator wear . therefore , dc motor brush design entails a trade-off between output power , speed , and efficiency/wear .
schwarzenegger was born in thal , a village bordering the city of graz in styria , austria and christened arnold alois . his parents were gustav schwarzenegger ( august 17 , 1907 – december 13 , 1972 ) , and aurelia schwarzenegger ( née jadrny ; july 29 , 1922 – august 2 , 1998 ) . gustav was the local chief of police , and had served in world war ii as a hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the nazi party in 1938 , though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria . he married arnold 's mother on october 20 , 1945 ; – he was 38 , and she was 23 years old . according to schwarzenegger , both of his parents were very strict : " back then in austria it was a very different world , if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents , the rod was not spared .

as financial assets became more and more complex , and harder and harder to value , investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators , who came to rely on them , accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be . george soros commented that " the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves . similarly , the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products . it was a shocking abdication of responsibility .

a ballot initiative in colorado , known as amendment 36 , would have changed the way in which the state apportions its electoral votes . rather than assigning all 9 of the state 's electors to the candidate with a plurality of popular votes , under the amendment colorado would have assigned presidential electors proportionally to the statewide vote count , which would be a unique system ( nebraska and maine assign electoral votes based on vote totals within each congressional district ) . detractors claimed that this splitting would diminish colorado 's influence in the electoral college , and the amendment ultimately failed , receiving only 34 % of the vote .

hokkien originated from quanzhou . after the opium war in 1842 , xiamen ( amoy ) became one of the major treaty ports to be opened for trade with the outside world . from mid-19th century onwards , xiamen slowly developed to become the political and economical center of the hokkien-speaking region in china . this caused amoy dialect to gradually replace the position of dialect variants from quanzhou and zhangzhou . from mid-19th century until the end of world war ii , western diplomats usually learned amoy hokkien as the preferred dialect if they were to communicate with the hokkien-speaking populace in china or south-east asia . in the 1940s and 1950s , taiwan also held amoy hokkien as its standard and tended to incline itself towards amoy dialect .

the silurian is a major division of the geologic timescale that started about 443.8 ± 1.5 ma . during the silurian , gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes , but there is evidence that the silurian ice caps were less extensive than those of the late ordovician glaciation . the melting of ice caps and glaciers contributed to a rise in sea levels , recognizable from the fact that silurian sediments overlie eroded ordovician sediments , forming an unconformity . other cratons and continent fragments drifted together near the equator , starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as euramerica . the vast ocean of panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere . other minor oceans include proto-tethys , paleo-tethys , rheic ocean , a seaway of iapetus ocean ( now in between avalonia and laurentia ) , and newly formed ural ocean .
the debating societies discussed an extremely wide range of topics . before the enlightenment , most intellectual debates revolved around " confessional " – that is , catholic , lutheran , reformed ( calvinist ) , or anglican issues , and the main aim of these debates was to establish which bloc of faith ought to have the " monopoly of truth and a god-given title to authority " . after this date everything thus previously rooted in tradition was questioned and often replaced by new concepts in the light of philosophical reason . after the second half of the 17th century and during the 18th century , a " general process of rationalization and secularization set in , " and confessional disputes were reduced to a secondary status in favor of the " escalating contest between faith and incredulity " .
surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s , gained momentum in the early 1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s . components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the pcb surface , instead of wire leads to pass through holes . components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting , allowing much smaller pcb assemblies with much higher circuit densities . surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation , reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates . components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes . surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components , and passive components much cheaper ; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices ( smds ) are determined more by the chip itself than the package , with little price advantage over larger packages . some wire-ended components , such as 1n4148 small-signal switch diodes , are actually significantly cheaper than smd equivalents .
rice is a staple in the diet of residents near the coast and millet a staple in the interior . fish , shellfish , fruits and vegetables are commonly eaten along with cereal grains , milk , curd and whey . the portuguese encouraged peanut production . vigna subterranea ( bambara groundnut ) and macrotyloma geocarpum ( hausa groundnut ) are also grown . black-eyed peas are also part of the diet . palm oil is harvested .
although provision is made in title 10 of the united states code for the secretary of the air force to appoint warrant officers , the air force does not currently use warrant officer grades , and is the only one of the u.s. armed services not to do so . the air force inherited warrant officer ranks from the army at its inception in 1947 , but their place in the air force structure was never made clear . [ citation needed ] when the congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in 1958 , air force officials privately concluded that these two new " super grades " could fill all air force needs then performed at the warrant officer level , although this was not publicly acknowledged until years later . [ citation needed ] the air force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959 , the same year the first promotions were made to the new top enlisted grade , chief master sergeant . most of the existing air force warrant officers entered the commissioned officer ranks during the 1960s , but small numbers continued to exist in the warrant officer grades for the next 21 years .
australian citizens and residents from other parts of the nation now have automatic right of residence on the island after meeting these criteria ( immigration ( amendment no . 2 ) act 2012 ) . australian citizens must carry either a passport or a document of identity to travel to norfolk island . citizens of all other nations must carry a passport to travel to norfolk island even if arriving from other parts of australia . holders of australian visas who travel to norfolk island have departed the australian migration zone . unless they hold a multiple-entry visa , the visa will have ceased ; in which case they will require another visa to re-enter mainland australia .
whitehead makes the startling observation that " life is comparatively deficient in survival value . " if humans can only exist for about a hundred years , and rocks for eight hundred million , then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place ; as whitehead humorously notes , " they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them . " he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment , an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living , living well , and living better . in other words , whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction . without such a goal , he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible .
on 18 january 2014 , the interim government instituted a new constitution following a referendum in which 98.1 % of voters were supportive . participation was low with only 38.6 % of registered voters participating although this was higher than the 33 % who voted in a referendum during morsi 's tenure . on 26 march 2014 abdel fattah el-sisi the head of the egyptian armed forces , who at this time was in control of the country , resigned from the military , announcing he would stand as a candidate in the 2014 presidential election . the poll , held between 26 and 28 may 2014 , resulted in a landslide victory for el-sisi . sisi was sworn into office as president of egypt on 8 june 2014 . the muslim brotherhood and some liberal and secular activist groups boycotted the vote . even though the military-backed authorities extended voting to a third day , the 46 % turnout was lower than the 52 % turnout in the 2012 election .
instead , he argues , this development has been artificially frozen in an " intermediate " state by the standardisation of dutch pronunciation in the 16th century , where lowered diphthongs found in rural dialects were perceived as ugly by the educated classes and accordingly declared substandard . now , however , in his opinion , the newly affluent and independent women can afford to let that natural development take place in their speech . stroop compares the role of polder dutch with the urban variety of british english pronunciation called estuary english .
apollo ( attic , ionic , and homeric greek : ἀπόλλων , apollōn ( gen ἀπόλλωνος ) ; doric : ἀπέλλων , apellōn ; arcadocypriot : ἀπείλων , apeilōn ; aeolic : ἄπλουν , aploun ; latin : apollō ) is one of the most important and complex of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology . the ideal of the kouros ( a beardless , athletic youth ) , apollo has been variously recognized as a god of music , truth and prophecy , healing , the sun and light , plague , poetry , and more . apollo is the son of zeus and leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress artemis . apollo is known in greek-influenced etruscan mythology as apulu .
the only attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the conference house on staten island between american delegates , including benjamin franklin , and british general lord howe on september 11 , 1776 . shortly after the british occupation began , the great fire of new york occurred , a large conflagration on the west side of lower manhattan , which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city , including trinity church .
after secession , some north carolinians refused to support the confederacy . some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western piedmont region remained neutral during the civil war , while some covertly supported the union cause during the conflict . approximately 2,000 north carolinians from western north carolina enlisted in the union army and fought for the north in the war . two additional union army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state , which were occupied by union forces in 1862 and 1863 . numerous slaves escaped to union lines , where they became essentially free .
timely 's first publication , marvel comics # 1 ( cover dated oct. 1939 ) , included the first appearance of carl burgos ' android superhero the human torch , and the first appearances of bill everett 's anti-hero namor the sub-mariner , among other features . the issue was a great success , with it and a second printing the following month selling , combined , nearly 900,000 copies . while its contents came from an outside packager , funnies , inc. , timely had its own staff in place by the following year . the company 's first true editor , writer-artist joe simon , teamed with artist and emerging industry notable jack kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed superheroes , captain america , in captain america comics # 1 ( march 1941 ) . it , too , proved a hit , with sales of nearly one million . goodman formed timely comics , inc. , beginning with comics cover-dated april 1941 or spring 1941 .
accounts of the use of leeches for the medically dubious practise of blood-letting have come from china around 30 ad , india around 200 ad , ancient rome around 50 ad and later throughout europe . in the 19th century medical demand for leeches was so high that some areas ' stocks were exhausted and other regions imposed restrictions or bans on exports , and hirudo medicinalis is treated as an endangered species by both iucn and cites . more recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery , and their saliva has provided anti-inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants , one of which also prevents tumors from spreading .
a number of technologies allow asphalt/bitumen to be mixed at much lower temperatures . these involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form " cutbacks " with reduced melting point , or mixtures with water to turn the asphalt/bitumen into an emulsion . asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 % asphalt/bitumen and typically less than 1.5 % chemical additives . there are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates , cationic and anionic . asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications . chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock , gravel or crushed slag . slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road . cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt , several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements .
the second largest higher-education institution is the national polytechnic institute ( ipn ) , which includes among many other relevant centers the centro de investigación y de estudios avanzados ( cinvestav ) , where varied high-level scientific and technological research is done . other major higher-education institutions in the city include the metropolitan autonomous university ( uam ) , the national school of anthropology and history ( enah ) , the instituto tecnológico autónomo de méxico ( itam ) , the monterrey institute of technology and higher education ( 3 campuses ) , the universidad panamericana ( up ) , the universidad la salle , the universidad del valle de mexico ( uvm ) , the universidad anáhuac , simon bolivar university ( usb ) , the alliant international university , the universidad iberoamericana , el colegio de méxico ( colmex ) , escuela libre de derecho and the centro de investigación y docencia económica , ( cide ) . in addition , the prestigious university of california maintains a campus known as " casa de california " in the city . the universidad tecnológica de méxico is also in mexico city .
africans were brought to charles town on the middle passage , first as " servants " , then as slaves . ethnic groups transported here included especially wolof , yoruba , fulani , igbo , malinke , and other people of the windward coast . an estimated 40 % of the total 400,000 africans transported and sold as slaves into north america are estimated to have landed at sullivan 's island , just off the port of charles town ; it is described as a " hellish ellis island of sorts ... . today nothing commemorates that ugly fact but a simple bench , established by the author toni morrison using private funds . "
idealism is a term with several related meanings . it comes via idea from the greek idein ( ἰδεῖν ) , meaning " to see " . the term entered the english language by 1743 . in ordinary use , as when speaking of woodrow wilson 's political idealism , it generally suggests the priority of ideals , principles , values , and goals over concrete realities . idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be , unlike pragmatists , who focus on the world as it presently is . in the arts , similarly , idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty , a standard of perfection , juxtaposed to aesthetic naturalism and realism .
at the start of john 's reign there was a sudden change in prices , as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals . this inflationary pressure was to continue for the rest of the 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for england . the resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from john 's military campaigns . it was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver , which was then re-minted into new coins ; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country , to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs . at those times when john was preparing for campaigns in normandy , for example , huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months , which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by , commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy . the result was political unrest across the country . john attempted to address some of the problems with the english currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage , improving its quality and consistency .
the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages . the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil , and contains both the national petroleum reserve–alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field . barrow , the northernmost city in the united states , is located here . the northwest arctic area , anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley , is often regarded as being part of this region . however , the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people .
in 2011 , bandai posted a countdown on a teaser site . once the countdown was finished , it revealed a reboot of the digimon world series titled digimon world re : digitize . an enhanced version of the game released on nintendo 3ds as digimon world re : digitize decode in 2013 . another role-playing game by the name digimon story : cyber sleuth is set for release in 2015 for playstation vita . it is part of the digimon story sub-series , originally on nintendo ds and has also been released with english subtitles in north america .
airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in jet aircraft traffic . runways were extended out to 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) . the fields were constructed out of reinforced concrete using a slip-form machine that produces a continual slab with no disruptions along the length . the early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals , an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding . these systems became commonplace in the united states by the 1970s .
like maradona , ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for internazionale . however , new heroes emerged , such as luís figo , patrick kluivert , luis enrique and rivaldo , and the team won a copa del rey and la liga double in 1998 . in 1999 , the club celebrated its centenari , winning the primera división title , and rivaldo became the fourth barcelona player to be awarded european footballer of the year . despite this domestic success , the failure to emulate real madrid in the champions league led to van gaal and núñez resigning in 2000 .
according to a demographic analysis reported by peter harvey ( 2013 ) : mahayana has 360 million adherents ; theravada has 150 million adherents ; and vajrayana has 18,2 million adherents . seven million additional buddhists are found outside of asia .
in the united states , new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the food and drug administration ( fda ) as being both safe and effective . this process generally involves submission of an investigational new drug filing with sufficient pre-clinical data to support proceeding with human trials . following ind approval , three phases of progressively larger human clinical trials may be conducted . phase i generally studies toxicity using healthy volunteers . phase ii can include pharmacokinetics and dosing in patients , and phase iii is a very large study of efficacy in the intended patient population . following the successful completion of phase iii testing , a new drug application is submitted to the fda . the fda review the data and if the product is seen as having a positive benefit-risk assessment , approval to market the product in the us is granted .
there are also parks on two major islands in the river : belle isle and brown 's island . belle isle , at various former times a powhatan fishing village , colonial-era horse race track , and civil war prison camp , is the larger of the two , and contains many bike trails as well as a small cliff that is used for rock climbing instruction . one can walk the island and still see many of the remains of the civil war prison camp , such as an arms storage room and a gun emplacement that was used to quell prisoner riots . brown 's island is a smaller island and a popular venue of a large number of free outdoor concerts and festivals in the spring and summer , such as the weekly friday cheers concert series or the james river beer and seafood festival .
a bantam is a small variety of domestic chicken , either a miniature version of a member of a standard breed , or a " true bantam " with no larger counterpart . the name derives from the town of bantam in java where european sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies . bantams may be a quarter to a third of the size of standard birds and lay similarly small eggs . they are kept by small-holders and hobbyists for egg production , use as broody hens , ornamental purposes , and showing .
hack wilson set a record of 56 home-runs and 190 runs-batted-in in 1930 , breaking lou gehrig 's mlb record of 176 rbi . ( in 1999 , a long-lost extra rbi mistakenly credited to charlie grimm had been found by cooperstown researcher cliff kachline and verified by historian jerome holtzman , increasing the record number to 191 . ) as of 2014 the record still stands , with no serious threats coming since gehrig ( 184 ) and hank greenberg ( 183 ) in the same era . the closest anyone has come to the mark in the last 75 years was manny ramirez 's 165 rbi in 1999 . in addition to the rbi record , wilson 56 home-runs stood as the national league record until 1998 , when sammy sosa and mark mcgwire hit 66 and 70 , respectively . wilson was named " most useful " player that year by the baseball writers ' association of america , as the official n.l . most valuable player award was not awarded until the next season .
on january 7 , 2012 , beyoncé gave birth to her first child , a daughter , blue ivy carter , at lenox hill hospital in new york . five months later , she performed for four nights at revel atlantic city 's ovation hall to celebrate the resort 's opening , her first performances since giving birth to blue ivy .
sanskrit ( /ˈsænskrɪt/ ; sanskrit : saṃskṛtam [ səmskr̩t̪əm ] or saṃskṛta , originally saṃskṛtā vāk , " refined speech " ) is the primary sacred language of hinduism , a philosophical language in buddhism , hinduism , sikhism and jainism , and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in greater india . it is a standardised dialect of old indo-aryan , originating as vedic sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to proto-indo-iranian and proto-indo-european . today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of india and is an official language of the state of uttarakhand . as one of the oldest indo-european languages for which substantial written documentation exists , sanskrit holds a prominent position in indo-european studies .
new haven lies in the transition between a humid continental climate ( köppen climate classification : dfa ) and humid subtropical climate ( köppen cfa ) , but having more characteristics of the former , as is typical of much of the new york metropolitan area . summers are humid and warm , with temperatures exceeding 90 °f ( 32 °c ) on 7–8 days per year . winters are cold with moderate snowfall interspersed with rainfall and occasionally mixed precipitation . the weather patterns that affect new haven result from a primarily offshore direction , thus reducing the marine influence of long island sound—although , like other marine areas , differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times .
much of the legislative style was adapted from the roman law code of justinian . as a result , roman ecclesiastical courts tend to follow the roman law style of continental europe with some variation , featuring collegiate panels of judges and an investigative form of proceeding , called " inquisitorial " , from the latin " inquirere " , to enquire . this is in contrast to the adversarial form of proceeding found in the common law system of english and u.s. law , which features such things as juries and single judges .
the links between religious and political life were vital to rome 's internal governance , diplomacy and development from kingdom , to republic and to empire . post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite : kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices . in the early republic , as presumably in the regal era , plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office , and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge . they resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office , public priesthood , and knowledge of civil and religious law . the senate appointed camillus as dictator to handle the emergency ; he negotiated a settlement , and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to concordia . the religious calendars and laws were eventually made public . plebeian tribunes were appointed , with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate . in principle , the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians . in reality , the patrician and to a lesser extent , plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the republican era and beyond .
thus , only in 1944 did the u.s. navy begin to use its 150 submarines to maximum effect : installing effective shipboard radar , replacing commanders deemed lacking in aggression , and fixing the faults in the torpedoes . japanese commerce protection was " shiftless beyond description , " [ nb 14 ] and convoys were poorly organized and defended compared to allied ones , a product of flawed ijn doctrine and training – errors concealed by american faults as much as japanese overconfidence . the number of u.s. submarines patrols ( and sinkings ) rose steeply : 350 patrols ( 180 ships sunk ) in 1942 , 350 ( 335 ) in 1943 , and 520 ( 603 ) in 1944 . by 1945 , sinkings of japanese vessels had decreased because so few targets dared to venture out on the high seas . in all , allied submarines destroyed 1,200 merchant ships – about five million tons of shipping . most were small cargo-carriers , but 124 were tankers bringing desperately needed oil from the east indies . another 320 were passenger ships and troop transports . at critical stages of the guadalcanal , saipan , and leyte campaigns , thousands of japanese troops were killed or diverted from where they were needed . over 200 warships were sunk , ranging from many auxiliaries and destroyers to one battleship and no fewer than eight carriers .
sometimes , poly-sided matches that pit every one for themselves will incorporate tagging rules . outside of kayfabe , this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action ( as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time ) , and to make the action in the ring easier to choreograph . one of the most mainstream examples of this is the four-corner match , the most common type of match in the wwe before it was replaced with its equivalent fatal four-way ; four wrestlers , each for themselves , fight in a match , but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time . the other two are positioned in the corner , and tags can be made between any two wrestlers .
most of egypt 's rain falls in the winter months . south of cairo , rainfall averages only around 2 to 5 mm ( 0.1 to 0.2 in ) per year and at intervals of many years . on a very thin strip of the northern coast the rainfall can be as high as 410 mm ( 16.1 in ) , mostly between october and march . snow falls on sinai 's mountains and some of the north coastal cities such as damietta , baltim , sidi barrany , etc . and rarely in alexandria . a very small amount of snow fell on cairo on 13 december 2013 , the first time cairo received snowfall in many decades . frost is also known in mid-sinai and mid-egypt . egypt is the driest and the sunniest country in the world , and most of its land surface is desert .
according to the preamble in the law of treaties , treaties are a source of international law . if an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law , the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law . this means that in case of a conflict with domestic law , international law will always prevail .
sexual identity and sexual behavior are closely related to sexual orientation , but they are distinguished , with sexual identity referring to an individual 's conception of themselves , behavior referring to actual sexual acts performed by the individual , and orientation referring to " fantasies , attachments and longings . " individuals may or may not express their sexual orientation in their behaviors . people who have a homosexual sexual orientation that does not align with their sexual identity are sometimes referred to as 'closeted ' . the term may , however , reflect a certain cultural context and particular stage of transition in societies which are gradually dealing with integrating sexual minorities . in studies related to sexual orientation , when dealing with the degree to which a person 's sexual attractions , behaviors and identity match , scientists usually use the terms concordance or discordance . thus , a woman who is attracted to other women , but calls herself heterosexual and only has sexual relations with men , can be said to experience discordance between her sexual orientation ( homosexual or lesbian ) and her sexual identity and behaviors ( heterosexual ) .
despite plans of expanding into other global regions and product segments , dell was heavily dependent on u.s. corporate pc market , as desktop pcs sold to both commercial and corporate customers accounted for 32 percent of its revenue , 85 percent of its revenue comes from businesses , and sixty-four percent of its revenue comes from north and south america , according to its 2006 third-quarter results . u.s. shipments of desktop pcs were shrinking , and the corporate pc market which purchases pcs in upgrade cycles had largely decided to take a break from buying new systems . the last cycle started around 2002 , three or so years after companies started buying pcs ahead of the perceived y2k problems , and corporate clients were not expected to upgrade again until extensive testing of microsoft 's windows vista ( expected in early 2007 ) , putting the next upgrade cycle around 2008 . heavily depending on pcs , dell had to slash prices to boost sales volumes , while demanding deep cuts from suppliers .
the climate of cork , like the rest of ireland , is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes . cork lies in plant hardiness zone 9b . met éireann maintains a climatological weather station at cork airport , a few kilometres south of the city . it should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself . there are also smaller synoptic weather stations at ucc and clover hill .
buddhism traditionally incorporates states of meditative absorption ( pali : jhāna ; skt : dhyāna ) . the most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the buddha . one key innovative teaching of the buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition . the difference between the buddha 's teaching and the yoga presented in early brahminic texts is striking . meditative states alone are not an end , for according to the buddha , even the highest meditative state is not liberating . instead of attaining a complete cessation of thought , some sort of mental activity must take place : a liberating cognition , based on the practice of mindful awareness .
in the middle ages , the church and the worldly authorities were closely related . martin luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle ( doctrine of the two kingdoms ) . the believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way . luther 's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably . the members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and , if necessary , to vote for his dismissal ( treatise on the right and authority of a christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call , install and dismiss teachers , as testified in scripture ; 1523 ) . calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen ( church elders , presbyters ) in his representative church government . the huguenots added regional synods and a national synod , whose members were elected by the congregations , to calvin 's system of church self-government . this system was taken over by the other reformed churches .
since the 16th century , the city has had a bear pit , the bärengraben , at the far end of the nydeggbrücke to house its heraldic animals . the currently four bears are now kept in an open-air enclosure nearby , and two other young bears , a present by the russian president , are kept in dählhölzli zoo .
the economy of himachal pradesh is currently the third-fastest growing economy in india . [ citation needed ] himachal pradesh has been ranked fourth in the list of the highest per capita incomes of indian states . this has made it one of the wealthiest places in the entire south asia . abundance of perennial rivers enables himachal to sell hydroelectricity to other states such as delhi , punjab , and rajasthan . the economy of the state is highly dependent on three sources : hydroelectric power , tourism , and agriculture .

from the early 12th century , french builders developed the gothic style , marked by the use of rib vaults , pointed arches , flying buttresses , and large stained glass windows . it was used mainly in churches and cathedrals , and continued in use until the 16th century in much of europe . classic examples of gothic architecture include chartres cathedral and reims cathedral in france as well as salisbury cathedral in england . stained glass became a crucial element in the design of churches , which continued to use extensive wall-paintings , now almost all lost .
initially sensors were optical and acoustic devices developed during the first world war and continued into the 1930s , but were quickly superseded by radar , which in turn was supplemented by optronics in the 1980s . command and control remained primitive until the late 1930s , when britain created an integrated system for adgb that linked the ground-based air defence of the army 's aa command , although field-deployed air defence relied on less sophisticated arrangements . nato later called these arrangements an " air defence ground environment " , defined as " the network of ground radar sites and command and control centres within a specific theatre of operations which are used for the tactical control of air defence operations " .
the tower has been inextricably linked with the everton area since its construction in 1787 . it was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals , and it still stands today on everton brow in netherfield road . the tower was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and , according to the college of arms in london , kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners . the crest was accompanied by the club motto , " nil satis nisi optimum " , meaning " nothing but the best is good enough " .
the human development index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called " western models of development " , failure to include any ecological considerations , lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization , focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking , lack of attention to development from a global perspective , measurement error of the underlying statistics , and on the undp 's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low ' , 'medium ' , 'high ' or 'very high ' human development countries .
from 1820 to 1848 sicily was shaken by upheavals , which culminated on 12 january 1848 , with a popular insurrection , the first one in europe that year , led by giuseppe la masa . a parliament and constitution were proclaimed . the first president was ruggero settimo . the bourbons reconquered palermo in 1849 , and remained under their rule until the time of giuseppe garibaldi . the famous general entered palermo with his troops ( the “ thousands ” ) on 27 may 1860 . after the plebiscite later that year palermo , along with the rest of sicily , became part of the new kingdom of italy ( 1861 ) .
high school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice , but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances , travel and player injuries , along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of august in most school districts under the traditional september–june academic term . a more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game , which brings together top players from a region . these games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer or at the end of the season . many of these games , which include the u.s. army all-american bowl and under armour all-america game , are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges .
there are more than 100 freshwater fish species , varying from the giant european catfish ( in the tagus international natural park ) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes ( along the western portion of country , for example ) . some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss , pollution and drought . up-welling along the west coast of portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish ; the portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world . marine fish species are more common , and include thousands of species , such as the sardine ( sardina pilchardus ) , tuna and atlantic mackerel . bioluminescent species are also well represented ( including species in different colour spectrum and forms ) , like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches .
the thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side , which are connected into a pair , one pair per segment . this arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments . many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction . some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen , whereas the wasp vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen . some insects , like the house fly musca domestica , have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion .
the exonym armenia is attested in the old persian behistun inscription ( 515 bc ) as armina ( ) . the ancient greek terms ἀρμενία ( armenía ) and ἀρμένιοι ( arménioi , " armenians " ) are first mentioned by hecataeus of miletus ( c. 550 bc – c. 476 bc ) . xenophon , a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions , describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc . he relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians . according to the histories of both moses of chorene and michael chamchian , armenia derives from the name of aram , a lineal descendant of hayk .
lighting or illumination is the deliberate use of light to achieve a practical or aesthetic effect . lighting includes the use of both artificial light sources like lamps and light fixtures , as well as natural illumination by capturing daylight . daylighting ( using windows , skylights , or light shelves ) is sometimes used as the main source of light during daytime in buildings . this can save energy in place of using artificial lighting , which represents a major component of energy consumption in buildings . proper lighting can enhance task performance , improve the appearance of an area , or have positive psychological effects on occupants .
after 1857 , the colonial government strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system , legal procedures , and statutes . the indian penal code came into being . in education , thomas babington macaulay had made schooling a priority for the raj in his famous minute of february 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of english as the medium of instruction . by 1890 some 60,000 indians had matriculated . the indian economy grew at about 1 % per year from 1880 to 1920 , and the population also grew at 1 % . however , from 1910s indian private industry began to grow significantly . india built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world . the british raj invested heavily in infrastructure , including canals and irrigation systems in addition to railways , telegraphy , roads and ports . however , historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history , with the nationalist school arguing that india was poorer at the end of british rule than at the beginning and that impoverishment occurred because of the british .
it is classified as a beta world city , ranking seventh in latin america and 73rd in the world . described as a " vibrant , eclectic place with a rich cultural life " , and " a thriving tech center and entrepreneurial culture " , montevideo ranks 8th in latin america on the 2013 mastercard global destination cities index . by 2014 , is also regarded as the fifth most gay-friendly major city in the world , first in latin america . it is the hub of commerce and higher education in uruguay as well as its chief port . the city is also the financial and cultural hub of a larger metropolitan area , with a population of around 2 million .
26 march 1991 is the day that marks the clash between military soldiers and peaceful demonstrating students which climaxed in the massacre of dozens under the orders of then president moussa traoré . he and three associates were later tried and convicted and received the death sentence for their part in the decision-making of that day . nowadays , the day is a national holiday in order to remember the tragic events and the people that were killed . [ unreliable source ? ] the coup is remembered as mali 's march revolution of 1991 .

whereas greg had limited his illustrative examples to english renaissance drama , where his expertise lay , bowers argued that the rationale was " the most workable editorial principle yet contrived to produce a critical text that is authoritative in the maximum of its details whether the author be shakespeare , dryden , fielding , nathaniel hawthorne , or stephen crane . the principle is sound without regard for the literary period . " for works where an author 's manuscript survived – a case greg had not considered – bowers concluded that the manuscript should generally serve as copy-text . citing the example of nathaniel hawthorne , he noted :
clickjacking , also known as " ui redress attack or user interface redress attack " , is a malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page . this is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers . the attacker is basically " hijacking " the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page , most likely owned by someone else . a similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes . carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets , iframes , buttons and text boxes , a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker .
the times magazine features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities , fashion and beauty , food and drink , homes and gardens or simply writers ' anecdotes . notable contributors include giles coren , food and drink writer of the year in 2005 and nadiya hussain , winner of bbc 's the great british bake off .
tuvalu experiences the effects of el niño and la niña caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central pacific . el niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones , while la niña effects increase the chances of drought . typically the islands of tuvalu receive between 200 to 400 mm ( 8 to 16 in ) of rainfall per month . however , in 2011 a weak la niña effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around tuvalu . a state of emergency was declared on 28 september 2011 ; with rationing of fresh-water on the islands of funafuti and nukulaelae . households on funafuti and nukulaelae were restricted to two buckets of fresh water per day ( 40 litres ) .
though decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean , it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business , as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 u.s. vs. paramount pictures , et al . decision . leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose , and in 1950 mca agent lew wasserman made a deal with universal for his client james stewart that would change the rules of the business . wasserman 's deal gave stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary . when one of those films , winchester '73 , proved to be a hit , the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at universal , and eventually at other studios as well .
napoleon maintained strict , efficient work habits , prioritizing what needed to be done . he cheated at cards , but repaid the losses ; he had to win at everything he attempted . he kept relays of staff and secretaries at work . unlike many generals , napoleon did not examine history to ask what hannibal or alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation . critics said he won many battles simply because of luck ; napoleon responded , " give me lucky generals , " aware that " luck " comes to leaders who recognize opportunity , and seize it . dwyer argues that napoleon 's victories at austerlitz and jena in 1805-06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity , leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility . by the russian campaign in 1812 , however , napoleon seems to have lost his verve . with crisis after crisis at hand , he rarely rose to the occasion . some historians have suggested a physical deterioration , but others note that an impaired napoleon was still a brilliant general .
a major international priority for tuvalu in the un , at the 2002 earth summit in johannesburg , south africa and in other international fora , is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising . tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the kyoto protocol . in december 2009 the islands stalled talks on climate change at the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen , fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions . their chief negotiator stated , " tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting . "
under modern constitutional conventions , the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers . since these ministers most often maintain the support of parliament and are the ones who obtain the passage of bills , it is highly improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent . an exception is sometimes stated to be if bills are not passed in good faith , though it is difficult to make an interpretation on what this circumstance might constitute . hence , in modern practice , royal assent is always granted ; a refusal to do so would be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch 's reserve powers .
at the end of the second world war , canada possessed the fourth-largest air force and fifth-largest naval surface fleet in the world , as well as the largest volunteer army ever fielded . conscription for overseas service was introduced only near the end of the war , and only 2,400 conscripts actually made it into battle . originally , canada was thought to have had the third-largest navy in the world , but with the fall of the soviet union , new data based on japanese and soviet sources found that to be incorrect .
the arthashastra and the edicts of ashoka are the primary written records of the mauryan times . archaeologically , this period falls into the era of northern black polished ware ( nbpw ) . the mauryan empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society . however , the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government . although there was no banking in the mauryan society , usury was customary . a significant amount of written records on slavery are found , suggesting a prevalence thereof . during this period , a high quality steel called wootz steel was developed in south india and was later exported to china and arabia .
regulation of hunting within the united states dates from the 19th century . some modern hunters see themselves as conservationists and sportsmen in the mode of theodore roosevelt and the boone and crockett club . local hunting clubs and national organizations provide hunter education and help protect the future of the sport by buying land for future hunting use . some groups represent a specific hunting interest , such as ducks unlimited , pheasants forever , or the delta waterfowl foundation . many hunting groups also participate in lobbying the federal government and state government .
in the language of the noble eightfold path , samyaksamādhi is " right concentration " . the primary means of cultivating samādhi is meditation . upon development of samādhi , one 's mind becomes purified of defilement , calm , tranquil , and luminous .
beidou-2 ( formerly known as compass ) is not an extension to the older beidou-1 , but rather supersedes it outright . the new system will be a constellation of 35 satellites , which include 5 geostationary orbit satellites for backward compatibility with beidou-1 , and 30 non-geostationary satellites ( 27 in medium earth orbit and 3 in inclined geosynchronous orbit ) , that will offer complete coverage of the globe .
the premier league sells its television rights on a collective basis . this is in contrast to some other european leagues , including la liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . the money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . the income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
after defeating the visigoths in only a few months , the umayyad caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula . beginning in 711 , the land that is now portugal became part of the vast umayyad caliphate 's empire of damascus , which stretched from the indus river in the indian sub-continent ( now pakistan ) up to the south of france , until its collapse in 750 . that year the west of the empire gained its independence under abd-ar-rahman i with the establishment of the emirate of córdoba . after almost two centuries , the emirate became the caliphate of córdoba in 929 , until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms , called taifa kingdoms .
hirsch held the opinion that judaism demands an application of torah thought to the entire realm of human experience , including the secular disciplines . his approach was termed the torah im derech eretz approach , or " neo-orthodoxy " . while insisting on strict adherence to jewish beliefs and practices , he held that jews should attempt to engage and influence the modern world , and encouraged those secular studies compatible with torah thought . this pattern of religious and secular involvement has been evident at many times in jewish history . scholars [ who ? ] believe it was characteristic of the jews in babylon during the amoraic and geonic periods , and likewise in early medieval spain , shown by their engagement with both muslim and christian society . it appeared as the traditional response to cultural and scientific innovation .
in 1971 , the united states department of health , education , and welfare approached marvel comics editor-in-chief stan lee to do a comic book story about drug abuse . lee agreed and wrote a three-part spider-man story portraying drug use as dangerous and unglamorous . however , the industry 's self-censorship board , the comics code authority , refused to approve the story because of the presence of narcotics , deeming the context of the story irrelevant . lee , with goodman 's approval , published the story regardless in the amazing spider-man # 96–98 ( may–july 1971 ) , without the comics code seal . the market reacted well to the storyline , and the cca subsequently revised the code the same year .
during the last decade , philadelphia experienced a large shift in its age profile . in 2000 , the city 's population pyramid had a largely stationary shape . in 2013 , the city took on an expansive pyramid shape , with an increase in the three millennial age groups , 20 to 24 , 25 to 29 , and 30 to 34 . the city 's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city 's largest age cohort . according to the 2010 census , 343,837 ( 22.5 % ) were under the age of 18 ; 203,697 ( 13.3 % ) from 18 to 25 ; 434,385 ( 28.5 % ) from 25 to 44 ; 358,778 ( 23.5 % ) from 45 to 64 ; and 185,309 ( 12.1 % ) who were 65 years of age or older . the median age was 33.5 years . for every 100 females there were 89.4 males . for every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 85.7 males . the city had 22,018 births in 2013 , down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008 . philadelphia 's death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century , 13,691 deaths in 2013 . another factor attributing to the population increase is philadelphia 's immigration rate . in 2013 , 12.7 percent of residents were foreign-born , just shy of the national average , 13.1 percent .
during the period of late mahayana buddhism , four major types of thought developed : madhyamaka , yogacara , tathagatagarbha , and buddhist logic as the last and most recent . in india , the two main philosophical schools of the mahayana were the madhyamaka and the later yogacara . according to dan lusthaus , madhyamaka and yogacara have a great deal in common , and the commonality stems from early buddhism . there were no great indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought .
many instruments originated during the renaissance ; others were variations of , or improvements upon , instruments that had existed previously . some have survived to the present day ; others have disappeared , only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments . as in the modern day , instruments may be classified as brass , strings , percussion , and woodwind .
the lobund institute grew out of pioneering research in germ-free-life which began in 1928 . this area of research originated in a question posed by pasteur as to whether animal life was possible without bacteria . though others had taken up this idea , their research was short lived and inconclusive . lobund was the first research organization to answer definitively , that such life is possible and that it can be prolonged through generations . but the objective was not merely to answer pasteur 's question but also to produce the germ free animal as a new tool for biological and medical research . this objective was reached and for years lobund was a unique center for the study and production of germ free animals and for their use in biological and medical investigations . today the work has spread to other universities . in the beginning it was under the department of biology and a program leading to the master 's degree accompanied the research program . in the 1940s lobund achieved independent status as a purely research organization and in 1950 was raised to the status of an institute . in 1958 it was brought back into the department of biology as integral part of that department , but with its own program leading to the degree of phd in gnotobiotics .
groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas . mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups . for example , henri poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group . by means of this connection , topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i [ › ] for example , elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops . the second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point . the blue loop is considered null-homotopic ( and thus irrelevant ) , because it can be continuously shrunk to a point . the presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point . the fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic , generated by the orange loop ( or any other loop winding once around the hole ) . this way , the fundamental group detects the hole .
ku 's school of business launched interdisciplinary management science graduate studies in operations research during fall semester 1965 . the program provided the foundation for decision science applications supporting nasa project apollo command capsule recovery operations .
football is largely considered the nigeria 's national sport and the country has its own premier league of football . nigeria 's national football team , known as the " super eagles " , has made the world cup on five occasions 1994 , 1998 , 2002 , 2010 , and most recently in 2014 . in april 1994 , the super eagles ranked 5th in the fifa world rankings , the highest ranking achieved by an african football team . they won the african cup of nations in 1980 , 1994 , and 2013 , and have also hosted the u-17 & u-20 world cup . they won the gold medal for football in the 1996 summer olympics ( in which they beat argentina ) becoming the first african football team to win gold in olympic football .
the fauna in the state is just as diverse as the flora and varies greatly due to the large contrast in climates . in the mountain zone of the state the most observed mammals are : mexican fox squirrel ( sciurus nayaritensis ) , antelope jackrabbit ( lepus alleni ) , raccoon ( procyon lotor ) , hooded skunk ( mephitis macroura ) , wild boar ( sus scrofa ) , collared peccary ( pecari tajacu ) , white-tailed deer ( odocoileus virginianus ) , mule deer odocoileus hemionus , american bison bison bison , cougar ( puma concolor ) , eastern cottontail sylvilagus floridanus , north american porcupine erethizon dorsatum , bobcat lynx rufus , mexican wolf canis lupus baileyi , and coyote canis latrans . american black bear ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers . the mexican wolf , once abundant , has been extirpated . the main cause of degradation has been grazing . although there are many reptilian species in the mountains the most observed species include : northern mexican pine snake , pituophis deppei jani , texas horned lizard ( phrynosoma cornutum ) , rock rattlesnake ( crotalus lepidus ) , black-tailed rattlesnake ( crotalus molossus ) , and plateau tiger salamander ambystoma velasci , one of possibly many amphibians to be found in the mountains .
a thriving market of unlicensed nes hardware clones emerged during the climax of the console 's popularity . initially , such clones were popular in markets where nintendo never issued a legitimate version of the console . in particular , the dendy ( russian : де́нди ) , an unlicensed hardware clone produced in taiwan and sold in the former soviet union , emerged as the most popular video game console of its time in that setting and it enjoyed a degree of fame roughly equivalent to that experienced by the nes/famicom in north america and japan . a famicom clone was marketed in argentina under the name of " family game " , resembling the original hardware design . the micro genius ( simplified chinese : 小天才 ) was marketed in southeast asia as an alternative to the famicom ; samurai was the popular pal alternative to the nes ; and in central europe , especially poland , the pegasus was available . samurai was also available in india in early 90s which was the first instance of console gaming in india .
with the rise of disco in the us and punk rock in the uk , hard rock 's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade . disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held . early punk bands like the ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock , with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos . however , new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s . 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of foreigner , who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s . midwestern groups like kansas , reo speedwagon and styx helped further cement heavy rock in the midwest as a form of stadium rock . in 1978 , van halen emerged from the los angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist eddie van halen . he popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping , showcased on the song " eruption " from the album van halen , which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion , while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar .
the declining trend however continued into season eight , as total viewers numbers fell by 5–10 % for early episodes compared to season seven , and by 9 % for the finale . in season nine , idol 's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken , when nbc 's coverage of the 2010 winter olympics on february 17 beat idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over idol 's 18.4 million . nevertheless , american idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched tv series for the sixth year running , breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by cbs ' all in the family and nbc 's the cosby show .
the united nations designates tuvalu as a least developed country ( ldc ) because of its limited potential for economic development , absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks . tuvalu participates in the enhanced integrated framework for trade-related technical assistance to least developed countries ( eif ) , which was established in october 1997 under the auspices of the world trade organisation . in 2013 tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country ( ldc ) status to a developing country to 2015 . prime minister enele sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by tuvalu to the funds provided by the united nations 's national adaptation programme of action ( napa ) , as " once tuvalu graduates to a developed country , it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like napa , which only goes to ldcs " . tuvalu had met targets so that tuvalu was to graduate from ldc status . prime minister , enele sopoaga wants the united nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from ldc status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like tuvalu in the application of the environmental vulnerability index ( evi ) .
through the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s , various methods to improve the dynamic range of mass-produced records involved highly advanced disc cutting equipment . these techniques , marketed , to name two , as the cbs discomputer and teldec direct metal mastering , were used to reduce inner-groove distortion . rca victor introduced another system to reduce dynamic range and achieve a groove with less surface noise under the commercial name of dynagroove . two main elements were combined : another disk material with less surface noise in the groove and dynamic compression for masking background noise . sometimes this was called " diaphragming " the source material and not favoured by some music lovers for its unnatural side effects . both elements were reflected in the brandname of dynagroove , described elsewhere in more detail . it also used the earlier advanced method of forward-looking control on groove spacing with respect to volume of sound and position on the disk . lower recorded volume used closer spacing ; higher recorded volume used wider spacing , especially with lower frequencies . also , the higher track density at lower volumes enabled disk recordings to end farther away from the disk center than usual , helping to reduce endtrack distortion even further .
tort law covers the entire imaginable spectrum of wrongs which humans can inflict upon each other , and of course , partially overlaps with wrongs also punishable by criminal law . although the american law institute has attempted to standardize tort law through the development of several versions of the restatement of torts , many states have chosen to adopt only certain sections of the restatements and to reject others . thus , because of its immense size and diversity , american tort law can not be easily summarized .
from november 17 , 1947 to december 23 , 1947 , john bardeen and walter brattain at at & t 's bell labs in the united states performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium , a signal was produced with the output power greater than the input . solid state physics group leader william shockley saw the potential in this , and over the next few months worked to greatly expand the knowledge of semiconductors . the term transistor was coined by john r. pierce as a contraction of the term transresistance . according to lillian hoddeson and vicki daitch , authors of a biography of john bardeen , shockley had proposed that bell labs ' first patent for a transistor should be based on the field-effect and that he be named as the inventor . having unearthed lilienfeld ’ s patents that went into obscurity years earlier , lawyers at bell labs advised against shockley 's proposal because the idea of a field-effect transistor that used an electric field as a " grid " was not new . instead , what bardeen , brattain , and shockley invented in 1947 was the first point-contact transistor . in acknowledgement of this accomplishment , shockley , bardeen , and brattain were jointly awarded the 1956 nobel prize in physics " for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect . "
in 1977 , hayek was critical of the lib-lab pact , in which the british liberal party agreed to keep the british labour government in office . writing to the times , hayek said , " may one who has devoted a large part of his life to the study of the history and the principles of liberalism point out that a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name 'liberal ' . certainly no liberal can in future vote 'liberal ' " . hayek was criticised by liberal politicians gladwyn jebb and andrew phillips , who both claimed that the purpose of the pact was to discourage socialist legislation .
to continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth , a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off , exhausted , and expanded again . this is the principle behind positive displacement pumps , like the manual water pump for example . inside the pump , a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to create a vacuum . because of the pressure differential , some fluid from the chamber ( or the well , in our example ) is pushed into the pump 's small cavity . the pump 's cavity is then sealed from the chamber , opened to the atmosphere , and squeezed back to a minute size .
during the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the greek language question , on whether the official language of greece should be the archaic katharevousa , created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language , or the dimotiki , the form of the greek language which evolved naturally from byzantine greek and was the language of the people . the dispute was finally resolved in 1976 , when dimotiki was made the only official variation of the greek language , and katharevousa fell to disuse .
the years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the " big four " with tottenham hotspur and manchester city both breaking into the top four . in the 2009–10 season , tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since everton in 2005 . criticism of the gap between an elite group of " super clubs " and the majority of the premier league has continued , nevertheless , due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other premier league clubs . manchester city won the title in the 2011–12 season , becoming the first club outside the " big four " to win since 1994–95 . that season also saw two of the big four ( chelsea and liverpool ) finish outside the top four places for the first time since 1994–95 .
until the 1960s the piers at weston-super-mare , clevedon , portishead and minehead were served by the paddle steamers of p and a campbell who ran regular services to barry and cardiff as well as ilfracombe and lundy island . the pier at burnham-on-sea was used for commercial goods , one of the reasons for the somerset and dorset joint railway was to provide a link between the bristol channel and the english channel . the pier at burnham-on-sea is the shortest pier in the uk . in the 1970s the royal portbury dock was constructed to provide extra capacity for the port of bristol .
after losing an extra-inning game in game 1 , the cubs rallied and took a 3 games to 1 lead over the wild card florida marlins in the nlcs . florida shut the cubs out in game 5 , but young pitcher mark prior led the cubs in game 6 as they took a 3–0 lead into the 8th inning and it was at this point when a now-infamous incident took place . several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of luis castillo . a chicago cubs fan by the name of steve bartman , of northbrook , illinois , reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of moisés alou for the second out of the 8th inning . alou reacted angrily toward the stands , and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball . alou at one point recanted , saying he would not have been able to make the play , but later said this was just an attempt to make bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten . interference was not called on the play , as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall . castillo was eventually walked by prior . two batters later , and to the chagrin of the packed stadium , cubs shortstop alex gonzalez misplayed an inning ending double play , loading the bases and leading to eight florida runs and a marlin victory . despite sending kerry wood to the mound and holding a lead twice , the cubs ultimately dropped game 7 , and failed to reach the world series .
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring " plain text " files between systems . the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems . teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both " carriage return " ( which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line ) and " line feed " ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) . the name " carriage return " comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line .
in the 1960s , the first nanjing yangtze river bridge was completed , and served as the only bridge crossing over the lower yangtze in eastern china at that time . the bridge was a source of pride and an important symbol of modern china , having been built and designed by the chinese themselves following failed surveys by other nations and the reliance on and then rejection of soviet expertise . begun in 1960 and opened to traffic in 1968 , the bridge is a two-tiered road and rail design spanning 4,600 metres on the upper deck , with approximately 1,580 metres spanning the river itself . since then four more bridges and two tunnels have been built . going in the downstream direction , the yangtze crossings in nanjing are : dashengguan bridge , line 10 metro tunnel , third bridge , nanjing yangtze river tunnel , first bridge , second bridge and fourth bridge .
camouflage is an important defense strategy , which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment . this sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families , especially those that feed on wood or vegetation , such as many of the leaf beetles ( family chrysomelidae ) or weevils . in some of these species , sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects . many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate . most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves , and the bodies of some species ( such as o. macklotti and palophus centaurus ) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise . some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift ( b. scabrinota , t. californica ) . in a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis , a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze . another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death ( catalepsy ) , where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period . the nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators .
by 16:50 , with the prussian southern attacks in danger of breaking up , the prussian 3rd guards infantry brigade of the second army opened an attack against the french positions at st. privat which were commanded by general canrobert . at 17:15 , the prussian 4th guards infantry brigade joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the prussian 1st guards infantry brigade . all of the prussian guard attacks were pinned down by lethal french gunfire from the rifle pits and trenches . at 18:15 the prussian 2nd guards infantry brigade , the last of the 1st guards infantry division , was committed to the attack on st. privat while steinmetz committed the last of the reserves of the first army across the mance ravine . by 18:30 , a considerable portion of the vii and viii corps disengaged from the fighting and withdrew towards the prussian positions at rezonville .
pia toscano , one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season , was unexpectedly eliminated on april 7 , 2011 , finishing in ninth place . her elimination drew criticisms from some former idol contestants , as well as actor tom hanks .
according to the 2010 census , 53.5 % of bronx 's population was of hispanic , latino , or spanish origin ( they may be of any race ) ; 30.1 % non-hispanic black or african american , 10.9 % of the population was non-hispanic white , 3.4 % non-hispanic asian , 0.6 % from some other race ( non-hispanic ) and 1.2 % of two or more races ( non-hispanic ) . the u.s. census considers the bronx to be the most diverse area in the country . there is an 89.7 percent chance that any two residents , chosen at random , would be of different race or ethnicity .
more radical reformists were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required , even if the eventual outcome meant the disintegration of the soviet union into several independent states . independence also accorded with yeltsin 's desires as president of the russian federation , as well as those of regional and local authorities to get rid of moscow ’ s pervasive control . in contrast to the reformers ' lukewarm response to the treaty , the conservatives , " patriots , " and russian nationalists of the ussr – still strong within the cpsu and the military – were opposed to weakening the soviet state and its centralized power structure .
during the late medieval period , cotton became known as an imported fiber in northern europe , without any knowledge of how it was derived , other than that it was a plant . because herodotus had written in his histories , book iii , 106 , that in india trees grew in the wild producing wool , it was assumed that the plant was a tree , rather than a shrub . this aspect is retained in the name for cotton in several germanic languages , such as german baumwolle , which translates as " tree wool " ( baum means " tree " ; wolle means " wool " ) . noting its similarities to wool , people in the region could only imagine that cotton must be produced by plant-borne sheep . john mandeville , writing in 1350 , stated as fact the now-preposterous belief : " there grew there [ india ] a wonderful tree which bore tiny lambs on the endes of its branches . these branches were so pliable that they bent down to allow the lambs to feed when they are hungrie [ sic ] . " ( see vegetable lamb of tartary . ) by the end of the 16th century , cotton was cultivated throughout the warmer regions in asia and the americas .
the early qing emperors adopted the bureaucratic structures and institutions from the preceding ming dynasty but split rule between han chinese and manchus , with some positions also given to mongols . like previous dynasties , the qing recruited officials via the imperial examination system , until the system was abolished in 1905 . the qing divided the positions into civil and military positions , each having nine grades or ranks , each subdivided into a and b categories . civil appointments ranged from attendant to the emperor or a grand secretary in the forbidden city ( highest ) to being a prefectural tax collector , deputy jail warden , deputy police commissioner or tax examiner . military appointments ranged from being a field marshal or chamberlain of the imperial bodyguard to a third class sergeant , corporal or a first or second class private .
unarmed fox hunting on horseback with hounds is the type of hunting most closely associated with the united kingdom ; in fact , " hunting " without qualification implies fox hunting . what in other countries is called " hunting " is called " shooting " ( birds ) or " stalking " ( deer ) in britain . originally a form of vermin control to protect livestock , fox hunting became a popular social activity for newly wealthy upper classes in victorian times and a traditional rural activity for riders and foot followers alike . similar to fox hunting in many ways is the chasing of hares with hounds . pairs of sight hounds ( or long-dogs ) , such as greyhounds , may be used to pursue a hare in coursing , where the greyhounds are marked as to their skill in coursing the hare ( but are not intended to actually catch it ) , or the hare may be pursued with scent hounds such as beagles or harriers . other sorts of foxhounds may also be used for hunting stags ( deer ) or mink . deer stalking with rifles is carried out on foot without hounds , using stealth .
thus , the languages mentioned above ( germanic , romance , slavic , greek ) have old terms for " green " which are derived from words for fresh , sprouting vegetation . however , comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently , over the past few millennia , and there is no identifiable single proto-indo-european or word for " green " . for example , the slavic zelenъ is cognate with sanskrit hari " yellow , ochre , golden " . the turkic languages also have jašɨl " green " or " yellowish green " , compared to a mongolian word for " meadow " .
the important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge , especially in anatomy , zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , mathematics and astronomy ; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems , especially those related to the problem of change and its causes ; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research . in the hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier greek thought : the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research , in their scientific investigations . thus , clear unbroken lines of influence lead from ancient greek and hellenistic philosophers , to medieval muslim philosophers and scientists , to the european renaissance and enlightenment , to the secular sciences of the modern day . neither reason nor inquiry began with the ancient greeks , but the socratic method did , along with the idea of forms , great advances in geometry , logic , and the natural sciences . according to benjamin farrington , former professor of classics at swansea university :
the term " modern " was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times ( ultimately derived from the latin adverb modo , meaning " just now ) . the european renaissance ( about 1420–1630 ) , which marked the transition between the late middle ages and early modern times , started in italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of classical art and literature , as well as the new perspectives gained from the age of discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope , expanding the borders of thought and knowledge .
in november , seattle averages more rainfall than any other u.s. city of more than 250,000 people ; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation . conversely , the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from june to september . seattle is one of the five rainiest major u.s. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation , and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states , along with some cities in the northeast , ohio and michigan . thunderstorms are rare , as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year . by comparison , fort myers , florida reports thunder on 93 days per year , kansas city on 52 , and new york city on 25 .
the armed forces ' 115,349 personnel are divided into a hierarchy of numerous ranks of officers and non-commissioned members . the governor general appoints , on the advice of the prime minister , the chief of the defence staff ( cds ) as the highest ranking commissioned officer in the armed forces and who , as head of the armed forces council , is in command of the canadian forces . the armed forces council generally operates from national defence headquarters ( ndhq ) in ottawa , ontario . on the armed forces council sit the heads of canadian joint operations command and canadian special operations forces command , the vice chief of the defence staff , and the heads of the royal canadian navy , the canadian army , the royal canadian air force and other key level 1 organizations . the sovereign and most other members of the canadian royal family also act as colonels-in-chief , honorary air commodores , air commodores-in-chief , admirals , and captains-general of canadian forces units , though these positions are ceremonial .
modern geology , like modern chemistry , gradually evolved during the 18th and early 19th centuries . benoît de maillet and the comte de buffon saw the earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars . jean-étienne guettard and nicolas desmarest hiked central france and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps . aided by chemical experimentation , naturalists such as scotland 's john walker , sweden 's torbern bergman , and germany 's abraham werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals—a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century . these early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of earth history that led james hutton , georges cuvier and alexandre brongniart , following in the steps of steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained : a principle first applied to the geology of the paris basin . the use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps , because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other , distant localities . over the first half of the 19th century , geologists such as charles lyell , adam sedgwick , and roderick murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout europe and eastern north america , setting the stage for more detailed , government-funded mapping projects in later decades .
the russian soviet federative socialist republic ( russian sfsr or rsfsr ; russian : российская советская федеративная социалистическая республика , tr . rossiyskaya sovetskaya federativnaya sotsialisticheskaya respublika listen ( help·info ) ) commonly referred to as soviet russia or simply as russia , was a sovereign state in 1917–22 , the largest , most populous , and most economically developed republic of the soviet union in 1922–91 and a sovereign part of the soviet union with its own legislation in 1990–91 . the republic comprised sixteen autonomous republics , five autonomous oblasts , ten autonomous okrugs , six krais , and forty oblasts . russians formed the largest ethnic group . to the west it bordered finland , norway and poland ; and to the south , china , mongolia and north korea whilst bordering the arctic ocean to the north , the pacific ocean to the east and the black sea and caspian sea to the south . within the ussr , it bordered the baltic republics ( lithuania , latvia and estonia ) , the byelorussian ssr and the ukrainian ssr to the west . to the south it bordered the georgian , azerbaijan and kazakh ssrs .
somali dialects are divided into three main groups : northern , benaadir and maay . northern somali ( or northern-central somali ) forms the basis for standard somali . benaadir ( also known as coastal somali ) is spoken on the benadir coast from adale to south of merca , including mogadishu , as well as in the immediate hinterland . the coastal dialects have additional phonemes which do not exist in standard somali . maay is principally spoken by the digil and mirifle ( rahanweyn ) clans in the southern areas of somalia .
napoleon was born in corsica to a relatively modest family of noble tuscan ancestry . napoleon supported the french revolution from the outset in 1789 while serving in the french army , and he tried to spread its ideals to corsica but was banished from the island in 1793 . two years later , he saved the french government from collapse by firing on the parisian mobs with cannons . the directory rewarded napoleon by giving him command of the army of italy at age 26 , when he began his first military campaign against the austrians and their italian allies , scoring a series of decisive victories that made him famous all across europe . he followed the defeat of the allies in europe by commanding a military expedition to egypt in 1798 , invading and occupying the ottoman province after defeating the mamelukes and launching modern egyptology through the discoveries made by his army .
in the 6th century bce , taoist teacher lao tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . the silver rule of confucianism from analects xv.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . humanistic thought is also contained in other confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in zuo zhuan , ji liang says , " people is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . so , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; neishi guo says , " gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " taoist and confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
bacteria can be grown in the laboratory on nutrient culture media , but viruses need living cells in which to replicate . many vaccines to infectious diseases can be grown in fertilised chicken eggs . millions of eggs are used each year to generate the annual flu vaccine requirements , a complex process that takes about six months after the decision is made as to what strains of virus to include in the new vaccine . a problem with using eggs for this purpose is that people with egg allergies are unable to be immunised , but this disadvantage may be overcome as new techniques for cell-based rather than egg-based culture become available . cell-based culture will also be useful in a pandemic when it may be difficult to acquire a sufficiently large quantity of suitable sterile , fertile eggs .
xiamen dialect , sometimes known as amoy , is the main dialect spoken in the chinese city of xiamen and its surrounding regions of tong'an and xiang'an , both of which are now included in the greater xiamen area . this dialect developed in the late ming dynasty when xiamen was increasingly taking over quanzhou 's position as the main port of trade in southeastern china . quanzhou traders began travelling southwards to xiamen to carry on their businesses while zhangzhou peasants began traveling northwards to xiamen in search of job opportunities . it is at this time when a need for a common language arose . the quanzhou and zhangzhou varieties are similar in many ways ( as can be seen from the common place of henan luoyang where they originated ) , but due to differences in accents , communication can be a problem . quanzhou businessmen considered their speech to be the prestige accent and considered zhangzhou 's to be a village dialect . over the centuries , dialect leveling occurred and the two speeches mixed to produce the amoy dialect .
book 7 ( beginning the iliadic half ) opens with an address to the muse and recounts aeneas ' arrival in italy and betrothal to lavinia , daughter of king latinus . lavinia had already been promised to turnus , the king of the rutulians , who is roused to war by the fury allecto , and amata lavinia 's mother . in book 8 , aeneas allies with king evander , who occupies the future site of rome , and is given new armor and a shield depicting roman history . book 9 records an assault by nisus and euryalus on the rutulians , book 10 , the death of evander 's young son pallas , and 11 the death of the volscian warrior princess camilla and the decision to settle the war with a duel between aeneas and turnus . the aeneid ends in book 12 with the taking of latinus ' city , the death of amata , and aeneas ' defeat and killing of turnus , whose pleas for mercy are spurned . the final book ends with the image of turnus ' soul lamenting as it flees to the underworld .
the greek kingdom of bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the seleucid empire , which , because of the size of the empire , had significant freedom from central control . between 255-246 bce , the governor of bactria , sogdiana and margiana ( most of present-day afghanistan ) , one diodotus , took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king . diodotus ii , son of diodotus , was overthrown in about 230 bc by euthydemus , possibly the satrap of sogdiana , who then started his own dynasty . in c. 210 bc , the greco-bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent seleucid empire under antiochus iii . while victorious in the field , it seems antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo ( perhaps sensing that bactria could not be governed from syria ) , and married one of his daughters to euthydemus 's son , thus legitimising the greco-bactria dynasty . soon afterwards the greco-bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded , possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the parthian king arsaces ii by antiochus .
the normal commercial disc is engraved with two sound-bearing concentric spiral grooves , one on each side , running from the outside edge towards the center . the last part of the spiral meets an earlier part to form a circle . the sound is encoded by fine variations in the edges of the groove that cause a stylus ( needle ) placed in it to vibrate at acoustic frequencies when the disc is rotated at the correct speed . generally , the outer and inner parts of the groove bear no intended sound ( an exception is split enz 's mental notes ) .
in august , the couple attended the 2011 mtv video music awards , at which beyoncé performed " love on top " and started the performance saying " tonight i want you to stand up on your feet , i want you to feel the love that 's growing inside of me " . at the end of the performance , she dropped her microphone , unbuttoned her blazer and rubbed her stomach , confirming her pregnancy she had alluded to earlier in the evening . her appearance helped that year 's mtv video music awards become the most-watched broadcast in mtv history , pulling in 12.4 million viewers ; the announcement was listed in guinness world records for " most tweets per second recorded for a single event " on twitter , receiving 8,868 tweets per second and " beyonce pregnant " was the most googled term the week of august 29 , 2011 .
much of new delhi , planned by the leading 20th-century british architect edwin lutyens , was laid out to be the central administrative area of the city as a testament to britain 's imperial pretensions . new delhi is structured around two central promenades called the rajpath and the janpath . the rajpath , or king 's way , stretches from the rashtrapati bhavan to the india gate . the janpath ( hindi : " path of the people " ) , formerly queen 's way , begins at connaught circus and cuts the rajpath at right angles . 19 foreign embassies are located on the nearby shantipath ( hindi : " path of peace " ) , making it the largest diplomatic enclave in india .
because of the acceptance of miscegenation , brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white . in addition , it abolished slavery without a civil war . the bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the us are notably absent in brazil . according to the 2010 census , 6.7 % of brazilians said they were black , compared with 6.2 % in 2000 , and 43.1 % said they were racially mixed , up from 38.5 % . in 2010 , elio ferreira de araujo , brazil 's minister for racial equality , attributed the increases to growing pride among his country 's black and indigenous communities .
tajikistan means the " land of the tajiks " . the suffix " -stan " ( persian : ـستان‎‎ -stān ) is persian for " place of " or " country " and tajik is , most likely , the name of a pre-islamic ( before the seventh century a.d. ) tribe . according to the library of congress 's 1997 country study of tajikistan , it is difficult to definitively state the origins of the word " tajik " because the term is " embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether turkic or iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of central asia . "
following the elections of 1973 , the constitution of swaziland was suspended by king sobhuza ii who thereafter ruled the country by decree until his death in 1982 . at this point sobhuza ii had ruled swaziland for 61 years , making him the longest ruling monarch in history . a regency followed his death , with queen regent dzeliwe shongwe being head of state until 1984 when she was removed by liqoqo and replaced by queen mother ntfombi tfwala . mswati iii , the son of ntfombi , was crowned king on 25 april 1986 as king and ingwenyama of swaziland .
furthermore , even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations . so , brain models that do n't reflect this are arguably too abstractive to be representative of brain operation ; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources . however , having said this , the human brain project is trying to build a realistic , detailed computational model of the entire human brain . it remains to be seen what level of success they can achieve in the time frame of the project and the wisdom of it has been publicly contested , with high-profile scientists on both sides of the argument .
the early settlement was often subject to attack from sea and land , including periodic assaults from spain and france ( both of whom contested england 's claims to the region ) , and pirates . these were combined with raids by native americans , who tried to protect themselves from so-called european " settlers , " who in turn wanted to expand the settlement . the heart of the city was fortified according to a 1704 plan by governor johnson . except those fronting cooper river , the walls were largely removed during the 1720s .
tuberculosis ( tb ) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) . tuberculosis generally affects the lungs , but can also affect other parts of the body . most infections do not have symptoms , known as latent tuberculosis . about 10 % of latent infections progress to active disease which , if left untreated , kills about half of those infected . the classic symptoms of active tb are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum , fever , night sweats , and weight loss . the historical term " consumption " came about due to the weight loss . infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms .
in 1985 , spielberg released the color purple , an adaptation of alice walker 's pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name , about a generation of empowered african-american women during depression-era america . starring whoopi goldberg and future talk-show superstar oprah winfrey , the film was a box office smash and critics hailed spielberg 's successful foray into the dramatic genre . roger ebert proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his great films archive . the film received eleven academy award nominations , including two for goldberg and winfrey . however , much to the surprise of many , spielberg did not get a best director nomination .
fungi communicate to coordinate and organize their growth and development such as the formation of marcelia and fruiting bodies . fungi communicate with their own and related species as well as with non fungal organisms in a great variety of symbiotic interactions , especially with bacteria , unicellular eukaryote , plants and insects through biochemicals of biotic origin . the biochemicals trigger the fungal organism to react in a specific manner , while if the same chemical molecules are not part of biotic messages , they do not trigger the fungal organism to react . this implies that fungal organisms can differentiate between molecules taking part in biotic messages and similar molecules being irrelevant in the situation . so far five different primary signalling molecules are known to coordinate different behavioral patterns such as filamentation , mating , growth , and pathogenicity . behavioral coordination and production of signaling substances is achieved through interpretation processes that enables the organism to differ between self or non-self , a biotic indicator , biotic message from similar , related , or non-related species , and even filter out " noise " , i.e . similar molecules without biotic content .
the ijm used the grant money to found " project lantern " and established an office in the philippines city of cebu . in 2010 the results of the project were published , in which the ijm stated that project lantern had led to " an increase in law enforcement activity in sex trafficking cases , an increase in commitment to resolving sex trafficking cases among law enforcement officers trained through the project , and an increase in services – like shelter , counseling and career training – provided to trafficking survivors " . at the time that the results were released , the ijm was exploring opportunities to replicate the model in other regions .
stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning . in response to stressful situations , the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters ( ex . glucocorticoids and catecholamines ) which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus . behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats . an experimental study by german cognitive psychologists l. schwabe and o. wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans . in this study , 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group . those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water ( the reputable secpt or ‘ socially evaluated cold pressor test ’ ) for up to three minutes , while being monitored and videotaped . both the stress and control groups were then presented with 32 words to memorize . twenty-four hours later , both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember ( free recall ) as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words ( recognition performance ) . the results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group , who recalled 30 % fewer words than the control group . the researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process .
capacitors may have their connecting leads arranged in many configurations , for example axially or radially . " axial " means that the leads are on a common axis , typically the axis of the capacitor 's cylindrical body – the leads extend from opposite ends . radial leads might more accurately be referred to as tandem ; they are rarely actually aligned along radii of the body 's circle , so the term is inexact , although universal . the leads ( until bent ) are usually in planes parallel to that of the flat body of the capacitor , and extend in the same direction ; they are often parallel as manufactured .
in 1963 , the teenage brian may and his father custom-built his signature guitar red special , which was purposely designed to feedback . sonic experimentation figured heavily in queen 's songs . a distinctive characteristic of queen 's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of may , mercury , and taylor best heard on the studio albums a night at the opera and a day at the races . some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer roy thomas baker , and their engineer mike stone . besides vocal harmonies , queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs . for instance , according to brian may , there are over 180 vocal overdubs in " bohemian rhapsody " . the band 's vocal structures have been compared with the beach boys , but may stated they were not " much of an influence " .
pfizer , once the city 's second largest employer , operated a large pharmaceutical research facility on the northeast side of ann arbor . on 22 january 2007 , pfizer announced it would close operations in ann arbor by the end of 2008 . the facility was previously operated by warner-lambert and , before that , parke-davis . in december 2008 , the university of michigan board of regents approved the purchase of the facilities , and the university anticipates hiring 2,000 researchers and staff during the next 10 years . the city is the home of other research and engineering centers , including those of lotus engineering , general dynamics and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) . other research centers sited in the city are the united states environmental protection agency 's national vehicle and fuel emissions laboratory and the toyota technical center . the city is also home to national sanitation foundation international ( nsf international ) , the nonprofit non-governmental organization that develops generally accepted standards for a variety of public health related industries and subject areas .
capital punishment was suspended in the united states from 1972 through 1976 primarily as a result of the supreme court 's decision in furman v. georgia . the last pre-furman execution was that of luis monge on june 2 , 1967 . in this case , the court found that the death penalty was being imposed in an unconstitutional manner , on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the united states constitution . the supreme court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional .
the total adult literacy rate is 99 percent . portuguese primary school enrollments are close to 100 percent . according to the oecd 's programme for international student assessment ( pisa ) 2009 , the average portuguese 15-year-old student , when rated in terms of reading literacy , mathematics and science knowledge , is placed at the same level as those students from the united states , sweden , germany , ireland , france , denmark , united kingdom , hungary and taipei , with 489 points ( 493 is the average ) . over 35 % of college-age citizens ( 20 years old ) attend one of the country 's higher education institutions ( compared with 50 % in the united states and 35 % in the oecd countries ) . in addition to being a destination for international students , portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students . all higher education students , both domestic and international , totaled 380,937 in 2005 .
until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the eighties " . contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . simon reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era " . nicholas lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song " .
in 2008 , tcm won a peabody award for excellence in broadcasting . in april 2010 , turner classic movies held the first tcm classic film festival , an event – now held annually – at the grauman 's chinese theater and the grauman 's egyptian theater in hollywood . hosted by robert osborne , the four-day long annual festival celebrates hollywood and its movies , and features celebrity appearances , special events , and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by the film foundation , an organization devoted to preserving hollywood 's classic film legacy .
all over europe rulers and city governments began to create universities to satisfy a european thirst for knowledge , and the belief that society would benefit from the scholarly expertise generated from these institutions . princes and leaders of city governments perceived the potential benefits of having a scholarly expertise develop with the ability to address difficult problems and achieve desired ends . the emergence of humanism was essential to this understanding of the possible utility of universities as well as the revival of interest in knowledge gained from ancient greek texts .
since the 19th century , many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or " gatekeeper " , sometimes described as the president 's private secretary , sometimes with no official title at all . eisenhower formalized this role , introducing the office of white house chief of staff – an idea he borrowed from the united states army . every president after lyndon johnson has also appointed staff to this position . initially , gerald ford and jimmy carter tried to operate without a chief of staff , but each eventually appointed one .
paris ' urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century , particularly where street-front alignment , building height and building distribution is concerned . in recent developments , a 1974-2010 building height limitation of 37 metres ( 121 ft ) was raised to 50 m ( 160 ft ) in central areas and 180 metres ( 590 ft ) in some of paris ' peripheral quarters , yet for some of the city 's more central quarters , even older building-height laws still remain in effect . the 210 metres ( 690 ft ) montparnasse tower was both paris and france 's tallest building until 1973 , but this record has been held by the la défense quarter tour first tower in courbevoie since its 2011 construction . a new project for la defense , called hermitage plaza , launched in 2009 , proposes to build two towers , 85 and 86 stories or 320 metres high , which would be the tallest buildings in the european union , just slightly shorter than the eiffel tower . they were scheduled for completion in 2019 or 2020 , but as of january 2015 construction had not yet begun , and there were questions in the press about the future of the project .
raleigh is also served by triangle transit ( known formerly as the triangle transit authority , or tta ) . triangle transit offers scheduled , fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between raleigh and the region 's other principal cities of durham , cary and chapel hill , as well as to and from the raleigh-durham international airport , research triangle park and several of the region 's larger suburban communities . triangle transit also coordinates an extensive vanpool and rideshare program that serves the region 's larger employers and commute destinations .
university education includes teaching , research , and social services activities , and it includes both the undergraduate level ( sometimes referred to as tertiary education ) and the graduate ( or postgraduate ) level ( sometimes referred to as graduate school ) . universities are generally composed of several colleges . in the united states , universities can be private and independent like yale university ; public and state-governed like the pennsylvania state system of higher education ; or independent but state-funded like the university of virginia . a number of career specific courses are now available to students through the internet .
they invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6 . this sexagesimal system became the standard number system in sumer and babylonia . they may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry , cavalry , and archers . they developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems , complete with courts , jails , and government records . the first true city-states arose in sumer , roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now syria and lebanon . several centuries after the invention of cuneiform , the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time , about 2600 bc , to messages and mail delivery , history , legend , mathematics , astronomical records , and other pursuits . conjointly with the spread of writing , the first formal schools were established , usually under the auspices of a city-state 's primary temple .
doctrines of jehovah 's witnesses are established by the governing body . the religion does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices ; members who openly disagree with the religion 's teachings are expelled and shunned . witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the governing body , reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of " god 's organization " . it also warns members to " avoid independent thinking " , claiming such thinking " was introduced by satan the devil " and would " cause division " . those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as " apostates " who are " mentally diseased " .
brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus , the amygdala , the striatum , or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory . for example , the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning , while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory . damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information . however , rather than implicating a specific area , it could be that damage to adjacent areas , or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit . further , it is not sufficient to describe memory , and its counterpart , learning , as solely dependent on specific brain regions . learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses , thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression .
puerto rico has been discussed as a potential 51st state of the united states . in a 2012 status referendum a majority of voters , 54 % , expressed dissatisfaction with the current political relationship . in a separate question , 61 % of voters supported statehood ( excluding the 26 % of voters who left this question blank ) . on december 11 , 2012 , puerto rico 's legislature resolved to request that the president and the u.s. congress act on the results , end the current form of territorial status and begin the process of admitting puerto rico to the union as a state .
as a teenager , he was greatly troubled by the metaphysics of aristotle , which he could not understand until he read al-farabi 's commentary on the work . for the next year and a half , he studied philosophy , in which he encountered greater obstacles . in such moments of baffled inquiry , he would leave his books , perform the requisite ablutions , then go to the mosque , and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties . deep into the night , he would continue his studies , and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution . forty times , it is said , he read through the metaphysics of aristotle , till the words were imprinted on his memory ; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure , until one day they found illumination , from the little commentary by farabi , which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams . so great was his joy at the discovery , made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery , that he hastened to return thanks to god , and bestowed alms upon the poor .
every year a " brotherhood and unity " relay race is organized in montenegro , macedonia and serbia which ends at the " house of flowers " in belgrade on may 25 – the final resting place of tito . at the same time , runners in slovenia , croatia and bosnia and herzegovina set off for kumrovec , tito 's birthplace in northern croatia . the relay is a left-over from yugoslav times , when young people made a similar yearly trek on foot through yugoslavia that ended in belgrade with a massive celebration .
some critics of stalin 's policy , such as the popular writer viktor suvorov , claim that stalin 's primary motive for signing the soviet–german non-aggression treaty was his calculation that such a pact could result in a conflict between the capitalist countries of western europe . [ citation needed ] this idea is supported by albert l . weeks . [ page needed ] claims by suvorov that stalin planned to invade germany in 1941 are debated by historians with , for example , david glantz opposing such claims , while mikhail meltyukhov supports them . [ citation needed ] the authors of the black book of communism consider the pact a crime against peace and a " conspiracy to conduct war of aggression . "
the federal supreme court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation ( leis ordinárias , or " ordinary laws " , in portuguese ) . a more recent ruling by the supreme court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat , by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation , though they remain beneath the constitution itself . additionally , as per the 45th amendment to the constitution , human rights treaties which are approved by congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment . the hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether ( and how ) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa .
23-year-old candice glover won the season with kree harrison taking the runner-up spot . glover is the first female to win american idol since jordin sparks . glover released " i am beautiful " as a single while harrison released " all cried out " immediately after the show . glover sold poorly with her debut album , and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label .
alaska ( i/əˈlæskə/ ) is a u.s. state situated in the northwest extremity of the americas . the canadian administrative divisions of british columbia and yukon border the state to the east while russia has a maritime border with the state to the west across the bering strait . to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas , the southern parts of the arctic ocean . to the south and southwest is the pacific ocean . alaska is the largest state in the united states by area , the 3rd least populous and the least densely populated of the 50 united states . approximately half of alaska 's residents ( the total estimated at 738,432 by the census bureau in 2015 ) live within the anchorage metropolitan area . alaska 's economy is dominated by the fishing , natural gas , and oil industries , resources which it has in abundance . military bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy .
since the armature windings of a direct-current or universal motor are moving through a magnetic field , they have a voltage induced in them . this voltage tends to oppose the motor supply voltage and so is called " back electromotive force ( emf ) " . the voltage is proportional to the running speed of the motor . the back emf of the motor , plus the voltage drop across the winding internal resistance and brushes , must equal the voltage at the brushes . this provides the fundamental mechanism of speed regulation in a dc motor . if the mechanical load increases , the motor slows down ; a lower back emf results , and more current is drawn from the supply . this increased current provides the additional torque to balance the new load .
egypt ( i/ˈiːdʒɪpt/ ; arabic : مِصر‎ miṣr , egyptian arabic : مَصر maṣr , coptic : ⲭⲏⲙⲓ khemi ) , officially the arab republic of egypt , is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of africa and southwest corner of asia , via a land bridge formed by the sinai peninsula . it is the world 's only contiguous eurafrasian nation . most of egypt 's territory of 1,010,408 square kilometres ( 390,000 sq mi ) lies within the nile valley . egypt is a mediterranean country . it is bordered by the gaza strip and israel to the northeast , the gulf of aqaba to the east , the red sea to the east and south , sudan to the south and libya to the west .
the process of morphological derivation in catalan follows the same principles as the other romance languages , where agglutination is common . many times , several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme , and some sound alternations can occur , for example elèctric [ əˈlɛktrik ] ( " electrical " ) vs. electricitat [ ələktrisiˈtat ] . prefixes are usually appended to verbs , for as in preveure ( " foresee " ) .
the hmwssb regulates rainwater harvesting , sewerage services and water supply , which is sourced from several dams located in the suburbs . in 2005 , the hmwssb started operating a 116-kilometre-long ( 72 mi ) water supply pipeline from nagarjuna sagar dam to meet increasing demand . the telangana southern power distribution company limited manages electricity supply . as of october 2014 , there were 15 fire stations in the city , operated by the telangana state disaster and fire response department . the government-owned india post has five head post offices and many sub-post offices in hyderabad , which are complemented by private courier services .
as a child , spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an orthodox jew with the perception of him by other children he played with . " it is n't something i enjoy admitting , " he once said , " but when i was seven , eight , nine years old , god forgive me , i was embarrassed because we were orthodox jews . i was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents ' jewish practices . i was never really ashamed to be jewish , but i was uneasy at times . " spielberg also said he suffered from acts of anti-semitic prejudice and bullying : " in high school , i got smacked and kicked around . two bloody noses . it was horrible . "
cuba , like many spanish territories , wanted to break free from spain . a pro-independence movement in cuba was supported by the u.s. , and cuban guerrilla leaders wanted annexation to the united states , but cuban revolutionary leader josé martí called for cuban nationhood . when the u.s. battleship maine sank in havana harbor , the u.s. blamed spain and the spanish–american war broke out in 1898 . after the u.s. won , spain relinquished claim of sovereignty over territories , including cuba . the u.s. administered cuba as a protectorate until 1902 . several decades later in 1959 , the corrupt cuban government of u.s.-backed fulgencio batista was overthrown by fidel castro . castro installed a marxist–leninist government allied with the soviet union , which has been in power ever since .
doctrinal development has had an important place in the restoration of the preachers . several institutions , besides those already mentioned , played important parts . such is the biblical school at jerusalem , open to the religious of the order and to secular clerics , which publishes the revue biblique . the faculty of theology at the university of fribourg , confided to the care of the dominicans in 1890 , is flourishing , and has about 250 students . the pontificium collegium internationale angelicum , the future pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum established at rome in 1908 by master hyacinth cormier , opened its doors to regulars and seculars for the study of the sacred sciences . in addition to the reviews above are the revue thomiste , founded by père thomas coconnier ( d. 1908 ) , and the analecta ordinis prædicatorum ( 1893 ) . among numerous writers of the order in this period are : cardinals thomas zigliara ( d. 1893 ) and zephirin gonzález ( d. 1894 ) , two esteemed philosophers ; alberto guillelmotti ( d. 1893 ) , historian of the pontifical navy , and heinrich denifle , one of the most famous writers on medieval history ( d . 1905 ) .

the eusocial insects build nest , guard eggs , and provide food for offspring full-time ( see eusociality ) . most insects , however , lead short lives as adults , and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates . a small number exhibit some form of parental care , where they will at least guard their eggs , and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood , and possibly even feeding them . another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest ( a burrow or an actual construction , either of which may be simple or complex ) , store provisions in it , and lay an egg upon those provisions . the adult does not contact the growing offspring , but it nonetheless does provide food . this sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps .
on april 25 , 2007 , internet archive and suzanne shell jointly announced the settlement of their lawsuit . the internet archive said it " ... has no interest in including materials in the wayback machine of persons who do not wish to have their web content archived . we recognize that ms . shell has a valid and enforceable copyright in her web site and we regret that the inclusion of her web site in the wayback machine resulted in this litigation . " shell said , " i respect the historical value of internet archive 's goal . i never intended to interfere with that goal nor cause it any harm . "
alpine glaciers can be straight rivers of ice , long sweeping rivers , spread in a fan-like shape ( piedmont glaciers ) , and curtains of ice that hang from vertical slopes of the mountain peaks . the stress of the movement causes the ice to break and crack loudly , perhaps explaining why the mountains were believed to be home to dragons in the medieval period . the cracking creates unpredictable and dangerous crevasses , often invisible under new snowfall , which cause the greatest danger to mountaineers .
to prevent piracy of films , the standard drill of film distribution is to have a movie first released through movie theaters ( theatrical window ) , on average approximately 16 and a half weeks , before having it released to blu-ray and dvd ( entering its video window ) . during the theatrical window , digital versions of films are often transported in data storage devices by couriers rather than by data transmission . the data can be encrypted , with the key being made to work only at specific times in order to prevent leakage between screens . coded anti-piracy marks can be added to films to identify the source of illegal copies and shut them down . as a result of these measures , the only versions of films available for piracy during the theatrical window are usually " cams " made by video recordings of the movie screens , which are of inferior quality compared to the original film version .
local train services operate in the central , southern and eastern sections of the city and are operated by south west trains , with stations at swaythling , st denys , millbrook , redbridge , bitterne , sholing and woolston . plans were announced by hampshire county council in july 2009 for the introduction of tram-train running from hythe ( on what is now a freight-only line to fawley ) via totton to southampton central station and on to fareham via st. denys , and swanwick . the proposal follows a failed plan to bring light rail to the portsmouth and gosport areas in 2005 .
the tucson padres played at kino veterans memorial stadium from 2011 to 2013 . they served as the aaa affiliate of the san diego padres . the team , formerly known as the portland beavers , was temporarily relocated to tucson from portland while awaiting the building of a new stadium in escondido . legal issues derailed the plans to build the escondido stadium , so they moved to el paso , texas for the 2014 season . previously , the tucson sidewinders , a triple-a affiliate of the arizona diamondbacks , won the pacific coast league championship and unofficial aaa championship in 2006 . the sidewinders played in tucson electric park and were in the pacific conference south of the pcl . the sidewinders were sold in 2007 and moved to reno , nevada after the 2008 season . they now compete as the reno aces .
besides parents , liu shaokun ( 刘绍坤 ) , a sichuan school teacher , was detained on june 25 , 2008 for " disseminating rumors and destroying social order " about the sichuan earthquake . liu ’ s family was later told that he was being investigated on suspicion of the crime of inciting subversion . liu had travelled to the shifang , taken photos of collapsed school buildings , and put them online . he had also expressed his anger at “ the shoddy tofu-dregs buildings ” ( 豆腐渣工程 ) in a media interview . he was ordered to serve one year of re-education through labor ( rtl ) . according to the organization human rights in china , liu has been released to serve his rtl sentence outside of the labor camp .
the etymology of the name bern is uncertain . according to the local legend , based on folk etymology , berchtold v , duke of zähringen , the founder of the city of bern , vowed to name the city after the first animal he met on the hunt , and this turned out to be a bear . it has long been considered likely that the city was named after the italian city of verona , which at the time was known as bern in middle high german . as a result of the find of the bern zinc tablet in the 1980s , it is now more common to assume that the city was named after a pre-existing toponym of celtic origin , possibly *berna " cleft " . the bear was the heraldic animal of the seal and coat of arms of bern from at least the 1220s . the earliest reference to the keeping of live bears in the bärengraben dates to the 1440s .
in the next centuries , armenia was in the persian empire 's sphere of influence during the reign of tiridates i , the founder of the arsacid dynasty of armenia , which itself was a branch of the eponymous arsacid dynasty of parthia . throughout its history , the kingdom of armenia enjoyed both periods of independence and periods of autonomy subject to contemporary empires . its strategic location between two continents has subjected it to invasions by many peoples , including the assyrians ( under ashurbanipal , at around 669–627 bc , the boundaries of the assyrian empire reached as far as armenia & the caucasus mountains ) , medes , achaemenid persians , greeks , parthians , romans , sassanid persians , byzantines , arabs , seljuks , mongols , ottomans , successive iranian safavids , afsharids , and qajars , and the russians .
beyoncé 's first solo recording was a feature on jay z 's " '03 bonnie & clyde " that was released in october 2002 , peaking at number four on the u.s . billboard hot 100 chart . her first solo album dangerously in love was released on june 24 , 2003 , after michelle williams and kelly rowland had released their solo efforts . the album sold 317,000 copies in its first week , debuted atop the billboard 200 , and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide . the album 's lead single , " crazy in love " , featuring jay z , became beyoncé 's first number-one single as a solo artist in the us . the single " baby boy " also reached number one , and singles , " me , myself and i " and " naughty girl " , both reached the top-five . the album earned beyoncé a then record-tying five awards at the 46th annual grammy awards ; best contemporary r & b album , best female r & b vocal performance for " dangerously in love 2 " , best r & b song and best rap/sung collaboration for " crazy in love " , and best r & b performance by a duo or group with vocals for " the closer i get to you " with luther vandross .
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring " plain text " files between systems . the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems . teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both " carriage return " ( which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line ) and " line feed " ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) . the name " carriage return " comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary . the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line .
humans regard certain insects as pests , and attempt to control them using insecticides and a host of other techniques . some insects damage crops by feeding on sap , leaves or fruits . a few parasitic species are pathogenic . some insects perform complex ecological roles ; blow-flies , for example , help consume carrion but also spread diseases . insect pollinators are essential to the life-cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms , including humans , are at least partly dependent ; without them , the terrestrial portion of the biosphere ( including humans ) would be devastated . many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit . silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey , respectively . in some cultures , people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects .
whitehead was unimpressed by this objection . in the notes of one his students for a 1927 class , whitehead was quoted as saying : " every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics . what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized . " in whitehead 's view , scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time , but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned . while whitehead acknowledged that " philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles , " he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress , even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic . for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy .
green can communicate safety to proceed , as in traffic lights . green and red were standardized as the colors of international railroad signals in the 19th century . the first traffic light , using green and red gas lamps , was erected in 1868 in front of the houses of parliament in london . it exploded the following year , injuring the policeman who operated it . in 1912 , the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in salt lake city , utah . red was chosen largely because of its high visibility , and its association with danger , while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red . today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should . in many video games , green signifies both health and completed objectives , opposite red .
the outreach director of hrtr , susan prager , is also the communication director of " friends of falun gong " , a quasi-government non-profit funded by fmr . congressman tom lanto 's wife and ambassador mark palmer of ned . a major setback to the event was caused by footballer diego maradona , scheduled to open the relay through buenos aires , pulling out in an attempt to avoid the olympic controversy . trying to avoid the scenes that marred the relay in the uk , france and the us , the city government designed a complex security operative to protect the torch relay , involving 1200 police officers and 3000 other people , including public employees and volunteers . overall , the protests were peaceful in nature , although there were a few incidents such as the throwing of several water balloons in an attempt to extinguish the olympic flame , and minor scuffles between olympic protesters and supporters from chinese immigrant communities .
guest judges may occasionally be introduced . in season two , guest judges such as lionel richie and robin gibb were used , and in season three donna summer , quentin tarantino and some of the mentors also joined as judges to critique the performances in the final rounds . guest judges were used in the audition rounds for seasons four , six , nine , and fourteen such as gene simmons and ll cool j in season four , jewel and olivia newton-john in season six , shania twain in season eight , neil patrick harris , avril lavigne and katy perry in season nine , and season eight runner-up , adam lambert , in season fourteen .
181st street is served by two new york city subway lines ; there is a 181st street station at fort washington avenue on the ind eighth avenue line ( a trains ) and a 181st street station at st. nicholas avenue on the irt broadway – seventh avenue line ( 1 trains ) . the stations are about 500 metres ( 550 yd ) from each other and are not connected . the george washington bridge bus terminal is a couple of blocks south on fort washington avenue . 181st street is also the last south/west exit in new york on the trans-manhattan expressway ( i-95 ) , just before crossing the george washington bridge to new jersey .
the in-no-cho filled the void left by the decline of fujiwara power . rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making . in time , many of the fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising minamoto family . while the fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne . the period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the in-no-cho and of the rise of the military class throughout the country . military might rather than civil authority dominated the government .
biodiversity , a contraction of " biological diversity , " generally refers to the variety and variability of life on earth . one of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species , between species , and between ecosystems . it is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems . this can refer to genetic variation , ecosystem variation , or species variation ( number of species ) within an area , biome , or planet . terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator , which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity . biodiversity is not distributed evenly on earth . it is richest in the tropics . marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the western pacific , where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans . there are latitudinal gradients in species diversity . biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots , and has been increasing through time , but will be likely to slow in the future .
somerset has 11,500 listed buildings , 523 scheduled monuments , 192 conservation areas , 41 parks and gardens including those at barrington court , holnicote estate , prior park landscape garden and tintinhull garden , 36 english heritage sites and 19 national trust sites , including clevedon court , fyne court , montacute house and tyntesfield as well as stembridge tower mill , the last remaining thatched windmill in england . other historic houses in the county which have remained in private ownership or used for other purposes include halswell house and marston bigot . a key contribution of somerset architecture is its medieval church towers . jenkins writes , " these structures , with their buttresses , bell-opening tracery and crowns , rank with nottinghamshire alabaster as england 's finest contribution to medieval art . "
expansive interior light has been a feature of gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened . the metaphysics of light in the middle ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings . much of this belief was based on the writings of pseudo-dionysius , a sixth-century mystic whose book , the celestial hierarchy , was popular among monks in france . pseudo-dionysius held that all light , even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows , was divine . to promote such faith , the abbot in charge of the saint-denis church on the north edge of paris , the abbot suger , encouraged architects remodeling the building to make the interior as bright as possible .
josip broz tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world ( 59 countries and yugoslavia ) . 21 decorations were from yugoslavia itself , 18 having been awarded once , and the order of the national hero on three occasions . of the 98 international awards and decorations , 92 were received once , and three on two occasions ( order of the white lion , polonia restituta , and karl marx ) . the most notable awards included the french legion of honour and national order of merit , the british order of the bath , the soviet order of lenin , the japanese order of the chrysanthemum , the german federal cross of merit , and the order of merit of italy .
although " nibbāna " ( sanskrit : nirvāna ) is the common term for the desired goal of this practice , many other terms can be found throughout the nikayas , which are not specified . [ note 35 ]
alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting , and about 2000 years after " natural bronze " had come into general use [ citation needed ] . bronze artifacts from the vinča culture date to 4500 bc . sumerian and egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 bc . the bronze age began in southeastern europe around 3700–3300 bc , in northwestern europe about 2500 bc . it ended with the beginning of the iron age , 2000–1000 bc in the near east , 600 bc in northern europe . the transition between the neolithic period and the bronze age was formerly termed the chalcolithic period ( copper-stone ) , with copper tools being used with stone tools . this term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the chalcolithic and neolithic are coterminous at both ends . brass , an alloy of copper and zinc , is of much more recent origin . it was known to the greeks , but became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire .
in the days following the disaster , an international reconnaissance team of engineers was dispatched to the region to make a detailed preliminary survey of damaged buildings . their findings show a variety of reasons why many constructions failed to withstand the earthquake .
prior to confederation in 1867 , residents of the colonies in what is now canada served as regular members of french and british forces and in local militia groups . the latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other european powers , aboriginal peoples , and later american forces during the american revolutionary war and war of 1812 , as well as in the fenian raids , red river rebellion , and north-west rebellion . consequently , the lineages of some canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century , when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of british north america against invasion by the united states .
seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of november , december and january , receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall ( by volume ) during this period . in late fall and early winter , atmospheric rivers ( also known as " pineapple express " systems ) , strong frontal systems , and pacific low pressure systems are common . light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year ; for instance , on average , less than 1.6 in ( 41 mm ) of rain falls in july and august combined when rain is rare . on occasion , seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events . one such event occurred on december 2–4 , 2007 , when sustained hurricane-force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong pineapple express event occurred in the greater puget sound area and the western parts of washington and oregon . precipitation totals exceeded 13.8 in ( 350 mm ) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km/h ( 130 mph ) along coastal oregon . it became the second wettest event in seattle history when a little over 130 mm ( 5.1 in ) of rain fell on seattle in a 24-hour period . lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage .

following a series of arcade game successes in the early 1980s , nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the famicom . masayuki uemura designed the system . original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive , but nintendo president hiroshi yamauchi rejected this and instead decided to go for a cheaper , more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles . a test model was constructed in october 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware , after which work began on programming tools . because 65xx cpus had not been manufactured or sold in japan up to that time , no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch . early famicom games were written on a system that ran on an nec pc-8001 computer and leds on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time .

most of the uk 's caribbean territories achieved independence after the departure in 1961 and 1962 of jamaica and trinidad from the west indies federation , established in 1958 in an attempt to unite the british caribbean colonies under one government , but which collapsed following the loss of its two largest members . barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s , but anguilla and the turks and caicos islands opted to revert to british rule after they had already started on the path to independence . the british virgin islands , cayman islands and montserrat opted to retain ties with britain , while guyana achieved independence in 1966 . britain 's last colony on the american mainland , british honduras , became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed belize in 1973 , achieving full independence in 1981 . a dispute with guatemala over claims to belize was left unresolved .
the growth of the internet , and particularly distributed search engines like kazaa and gnutella , have represented a challenge for copyright policy . the recording industry association of america , in particular , has been on the front lines of the fight against copyright infringement , which the industry calls " piracy " . the industry has had victories against some services , including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company napster , and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright . the electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based digital rights management tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works . laws such as the digital millennium copyright act have been enacted , that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems . equivalent provisions , to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in eu for some time , and are being expanded in , for example , article 6 and 7 the copyright directive . other examples are article 7 of the software directive of 1991 ( 91/250/eec ) , and the conditional access directive of 1998 ( 98/84/eec ) . this can hinder legal uses , affecting public domain works , limitations and exceptions to copyright , or uses allowed by the copyright holder . some copyleft licenses , like gnu gpl 3 , are designed to counter that . laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor 's program , or for accessibility reasons ; however , distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal .

in the late 19th century , after the berlin conference had ended , european empires sailed with their armies to the horn of africa . the imperial clouds wavering over somalia alarmed the dervish leader mohammed abdullah hassan , who gathered somali soldiers from across the horn of africa and began one of the longest anti-colonial wars ever . the dervish state successfully repulsed the british empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region . as a result of its successes against the british , the dervish state received support from the ottoman and german empires . the turks also named hassan emir of the somali nation , and the germans promised to officially recognize any territories the dervishes were to acquire . after a quarter of a century of holding the british at bay , the dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 , when britain for the first time in africa used airplanes to bomb the dervish capital of taleex . as a result of this bombardment , former dervish territories were turned into a protectorate of britain . italy similarly faced the same opposition from somali sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern somalia until the fascist era in late 1927 . this occupation lasted till 1941 and was replaced by a british military administration .
in turn , according to kozinski 's analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the u.s. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the judiciary acts ) , and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of u.s. appellate decisions by west publishing . the rule gradually developed , case-by-case , as an extension of the judiciary 's public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . the rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency , instability , and unpredictability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
by mid-1942 , the japanese found themselves holding a vast area from the indian ocean to the central pacific , even though they lacked the resources to defend or sustain it . moreover , combined fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed " barrier " defence . instead , japan decided on additional attacks in both the south and central pacific . while she had the element of surprise at pearl harbor , allied codebreakers had now turned the tables . they discovered an attack was planned against port moresby ; if it fell , japan would control the seas to the north and west of australia and could isolate the country . the carrier uss lexington under admiral fletcher joined uss yorktown and an american-australian task force to stop the japanese advance . the resulting battle of the coral sea , fought in may 1942 , was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and only aircraft were used to attack opposing forces . although lexington was sunk and yorktown seriously damaged , the japanese lost the carrier shōhō , and suffered extensive damage to shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of zuikaku , both of which missed the operation against midway the following month . although allied losses were heavier than japanese , the attack on port moresby was thwarted and the japanese invasion force turned back , a strategic victory for the allies . the japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate australia . moreover , japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships , planes and trained pilots .

historians have judged the qing dynasty 's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land , the historian edward l. dreyer said that " china ’ s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea . at the start of the opium war , china had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea ; british forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go ... ... in the arrow war ( 1856–60 ) , the chinese had no way to prevent the anglo-french expedition of 1860 from sailing into the gulf of zhili and landing as near as possible to beijing . meanwhile , new but not exactly modern chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions , bluffed russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in central asia , and defeated the french forces on land in the sino-french war ( 1884–85 ) . but the defeat of the fleet , and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to taiwan , forced china to conclude peace on unfavorable terms . "
the newly invented western electric moving coil or dynamic microphone was part of the wide range system . it had a flatter audio response than the old style wente condenser type and did n't require electronics installed in the microphone housing . signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback . groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts . the chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together , resulting in longer playback time . additionally , the problem of inner groove distortion , which plagued lateral cuts , could be avoided with the vertical cut system . wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax and the necessity of planing and polishing .

standing out in clarke 's ( and newton 's ) response to leibniz 's arguments is the bucket argument : water in a bucket , hung from a rope and set to spin , will start with a flat surface . as the water begins to spin in the bucket , the surface of the water will become concave . if the bucket is stopped , the water will continue to spin , and while the spin continues , the surface will remain concave . the concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water , since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin , it becomes concave as the water starts to spin , and it remains concave as the bucket stops .
it had been found that the proportion of non-repetitive dna can vary a lot between species . some e. coli as prokaryotes only have non-repetitive dna , lower eukaryotes such as c. elegans and fruit fly , still possess more non-repetitive dna than repetitive dna . higher eukaryotes tend to have more repetitive dna than non-repetitive ones . in some plants and amphibians , the proportion of non-repetitive dna is no more than 20 % , becoming a minority component .
it also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against minor league affiliates during the regular season , but worries of injuries to players , along with travel issues , have made this very rare . exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues , like chicago 's crosstown classic and new york 's subway series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play . the annual mlb all-star game , played in july between players from al teams and players from nl teams , was long considered an exhibition match , but as of 2003 this status was questioned because the league whose team wins the all-star game has been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming world series .

the humoral ( antibody ) response is defined as the interaction between antibodies and antigens . antibodies are specific proteins released from a certain class of immune cells known as b lymphocytes , while antigens are defined as anything that elicits the generation of antibodies ( " anti " body " gen " erators ) . immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both .
muhammad also ordered another siege on the banu qurayza during the invasion of banu qurayza , because according to muslim tradition he had been ordered to do so by the angel gabriel . al-waqidi claims muhammad had a treaty with the tribe which was torn apart . stillman and watt deny the authenticity of al-waqidi . al-waqidi has been frequently criticized by muslim writers , who claim that he is unreliable . 600-900 members of the banu qurayza were beheaded after they surrendered ( according to tabari and ibn hisham ) . another source says all males and 1 woman beheaded ( according to sunni hadith ) . two muslims were killed
most annelids have a pair of coelomata ( body cavities ) in each segment , separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries . each septum forms a sandwich with connective tissue in the middle and mesothelium ( membrane that serves as a lining ) from the preceding and following segments on either side . each mesentery is similar except that the mesothelium is the lining of each of the pair of coelomata , and the blood vessels and , in polychaetes , the main nerve cords are embedded in it . the mesothelium is made of modified epitheliomuscular cells ; in other words , their bodies form part of the epithelium but their bases extend to form muscle fibers in the body wall . the mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa , and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut . parts of the mesothelium , especially on the outside of the gut , may also form chloragogen cells that perform similar functions to the livers of vertebrates : producing and storing glycogen and fat ; producing the oxygen-carrier hemoglobin ; breaking down proteins ; and turning nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and urea to be excreted .
since 1718 , transportation to the american colonies had been a penalty for various criminal offences in britain , with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the atlantic . forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the 13 colonies in 1783 , the british government turned to the newly discovered lands of australia . the western coast of australia had been discovered for europeans by the dutch explorer willem jansz in 1606 and was later named new holland by the dutch east india company , but there was no attempt to colonise it . in 1770 james cook discovered the eastern coast of australia while on a scientific voyage to the south pacific ocean , claimed the continent for britain , and named it new south wales . in 1778 , joseph banks , cook 's botanist on the voyage , presented evidence to the government on the suitability of botany bay for the establishment of a penal settlement , and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail , arriving in 1788 . britain continued to transport convicts to new south wales until 1840 . the australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold , mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of victoria , making its capital melbourne the richest city in the world and the largest city after london in the british empire .
the january daily average is 33.0 °f ( 0.6 °c ) , though , in a normal winter , the temperature frequently rises to 50 °f ( 10 °c ) during thaws and dips to 10 °f ( −12 °c ) for 2 or 3 nights . july averages 78.1 °f ( 25.6 °c ) , although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent ; highs reach or exceed 90 °f ( 32 °c ) on 27 days of the year . the average window for freezing temperatures is november 6 thru april 2 , allowing a growing season of 217 days . early fall and late winter are generally dry ; february 's average of 2.64 inches ( 67 mm ) makes it the area 's driest month . the dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 °f ( 15 °c ) to 64.5 °f ( 18 °c ) .
although max insisted von neumann attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age , he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude . at the age of 15 , he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst gábor szegő . on their first meeting , szegő was so astounded with the boy 's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears . some of von neumann 's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by szegő , sketched out on his father 's stationery , are still on display at the von neumann archive in budapest . by the age of 19 , von neumann had published two major mathematical papers , the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers , which superseded georg cantor 's definition . at the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium , von neumann sat for and won the eötvös prize , a national prize for mathematics .
after gaining the master sword , link is cleansed of the magic that kept him in wolf form , obtaining the shadow crystal . now able to use it to switch between both forms at will , link is led by midna to the mirror of twilight located deep within the gerudo desert , the only known gateway between the twilight realm and hyrule . however , they discover that the mirror is broken . the sages there explain that zant tried to destroy it , but he was only able to shatter it into fragments ; only the true ruler of the twili can completely destroy the mirror of twilight . they also reveal that they used it a century ago to banish ganondorf , the gerudo leader who attempted to steal the triforce , to the twilight realm when executing him failed . assisted by an underground resistance group they meet in castle town , link and midna set out to retrieve the missing shards of the mirror , defeating those they infected . once the portal has been restored , midna is revealed to be the true ruler of the twilight realm , usurped by zant when he cursed her into her current form . confronting zant , link and midna learn that zant 's coup was made possible when he forged a pact with ganondorf , who asked for zant 's assistance in conquering hyrule . after link defeats zant , midna recovers the fused shadows , but destroys zant after learning that only ganondorf 's death can release her from her curse . returning to hyrule , link and midna find ganondorf in hyrule castle , with a lifeless zelda suspended above his head . ganondorf fights link by possessing zelda 's body and eventually by transforming into a beast , but link defeats him and midna is able to resurrect zelda .
the city also boasts an efficient network of public transportation , which mainly consists of bus , taxi and metro systems . the bus network , which is currently run by three companies since 2011 , provides more than 370 routes covering all parts of the city and suburban areas . nanjing metro line 1 , started service on september 3 , 2005 , with 16 stations and a length of 21.72 km . line 2 and the 24.5 km-long south extension of line 1 officially opened to passenger service on may 28 , 2010 . at present , nanjing has a metro system with a grand total of 223.6 kilometers ( 138.9 mi ) of route and 121 stations . they are line 1 , line 2 , line 3 , line 10 , line s1 and line s8 . the city is planning to complete a 17-line metro and light-rail system by 2030 . the expansion of the metro network will greatly facilitate the intracity transportation and reduce the currently heavy traffic congestion .
i love new york ( stylized i ❤ ny ) is both a logo and a song that are the basis of an advertising campaign and have been used since 1977 to promote tourism in new york city , and later to promote new york state as well . the trademarked logo , owned by new york state empire state development , appears in souvenir shops and brochures throughout the city and state , some licensed , many not . the song is the state song of new york .
many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties . uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope . uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons , and is fertile , meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor . another fissile isotope , uranium-233 , can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology . while uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons , uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons . in sufficient concentration , these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction . this generates the heat in nuclear power reactors , and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons . depleted uranium ( 238u ) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating .
after finishing the first draft and returning it to lippincott , the manuscript , at that point titled " go set a watchman " , fell into the hands of therese von hohoff torrey — known professionally as tay hohoff — a small , wiry veteran editor in her late 50s . hohoff was impressed . “ [ t ] he spark of the true writer flashed in every line , ” she would later recount in a corporate history of lippincott . but as hohoff saw it , the manuscript was by no means fit for publication . it was , as she described it , “ more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel. ” during the next couple of years , she led lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled to kill a mockingbird .
carnival is known as crop over and is barbados 's biggest festival . its early beginnings were on the sugar cane plantations during the colonial period . crop over began in 1688 , and featured singing , dancing and accompaniment by shak-shak , banjo , triangle , fiddle , guitar , bottles filled with water and bones . other traditions included climbing a greased pole , feasting and drinking competitions . originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest , it evolved into a national festival . in the late 20th century , crop over began to closely mirror the trinidad carnival . beginning in june , crop over runs until the first monday in august when it culminates in the finale , the grand kadooment .
digital cameras have far surpassed film in terms of sensitivity to light , with iso equivalent speeds of up to 409,600 , a number that is unfathomable in the realm of conventional film photography . faster processors , as well as advances in software noise reduction techniques allow this type of processing to be executed the moment the photo is captured , allowing photographers to store images that have a higher level of refinement and would have been prohibitively time consuming to process with earlier generations of digital camera hardware .
as a major chinese city , nanjing is home to many professional sports teams . jiangsu sainty , the football club currently staying in chinese super league , is a long-term tenant of nanjing olympic sports center . jiangsu nangang basketball club is a competitive team which has long been one of the major clubs fighting for the title in china top level league , cba . jiangsu volleyball men and women teams are also traditionally considered as at top level in china volleyball league .
in a 'letter to american people ' written by osama bin laden in 2002 , he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting america is because of its support of india on the kashmir issue . while on a trip to delhi in 2002 , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld suggested that al-qaeda was active in kashmir , though he did not have any hard evidence . an investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that al-qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in pakistan-administered kashmir with tacit approval of pakistan 's national intelligence agency inter-services intelligence . a team of special air service and delta force was sent into indian-administered kashmir in 2002 to hunt for osama bin laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the kashmiri militant group harkat-ul-mujahideen . u.s. officials believed that al-qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in kashmir in order to provoke conflict between india and pakistan . fazlur rehman khalil , the leader of the harkat-ul-mujahideen , signed al-qaeda 's 1998 declaration of holy war , which called on muslims to attack all americans and their allies . indian sources claimed that in 2006 , al-qaeda claimed they had established a wing in kashmir ; this worried the indian government . india also claimed that al-qaeda has strong ties with the kashmir militant groups lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammed in pakistan . while on a visit to pakistan in january 2010 , u.s. defense secretary robert gates stated that al-qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between india and pakistan .
official figures ( as of july 21 , 2008 12:00 cst ) stated that 69,197 were confirmed dead , including 68,636 in sichuan province , and 374,176 injured , with 18,222 listed as missing . the earthquake left about 4.8 million people homeless , though the number could be as high as 11 million . approximately 15 million people lived in the affected area . it was the deadliest earthquake to hit china since the 1976 tangshan earthquake , which killed at least 240,000 people , and the strongest in the country since the 1950 chayu earthquake , which registered at 8.5 on the richter magnitude scale . it is the 21st deadliest earthquake of all time . on november 6 , 2008 , the central government announced that it would spend 1 trillion rmb ( about us $ 146.5 billion ) over the next three years to rebuild areas ravaged by the earthquake , as part of the chinese economic stimulus program .
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms . cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them .
outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt , although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places , resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area . beyond this is the vast london commuter belt . greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london . the city is split by the river thames into north and south , with an informal central london area in its interior . the coordinates of the nominal centre of london , traditionally considered to be the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall , are approximately 51°30′26″n 00°07′39″w﻿ / ﻿51.50722°n 0.12750°w﻿ / 51.50722 ; -0.12750 .
after agreeing to sign the boxer protocol the government then initiated unprecedented fiscal and administrative reforms , including elections , a new legal code , and abolition of the examination system . sun yat-sen and other revolutionaries competed with reformers such as liang qichao and monarchists such as kang youwei to transform the qing empire into a modern nation . after the death of empress dowager cixi and the guangxu emperor in 1908 , the hardline manchu court alienated reformers and local elites alike . local uprisings starting on october 11 , 1911 led to the xinhai revolution . puyi , the last emperor , abdicated on february 12 , 1912 .
in may 2013 , the club launched a new crest to improve the reproducibility of the design in print and broadcast media , particularly on a small scale . critics [ who ? ] suggested that it was external pressure from sports manufacturers nike , inc. that evoked the redesign as the number of colours has been reduced and the radial effect have been removed , making the kit more cost efficient to reproduce . [ citation needed ] the redesign was poorly received by supporters , with a poll on an everton fan site registering a 91 % negative response to the crest . a protest petition reached over 22,000 signatures before the club offered an apology and announced a new crest would be created for the 2014–15 season with an emphasis on fan consultation . shortly afterwards , the head of marketing left the club .
on 7 january 2015 , two french muslim extremists attacked the paris headquarters of charlie hebdo and killed thirteen people , and on 9 january , a third terrorist killed four hostages during an attack at a jewish grocery store at porte de vincennes . on 11 january an estimated 1.5 million people marched in paris–along with international political leaders–to show solidarity against terrorism and in defence of freedom of speech . ten months later , 13 november 2015 , came a series of coordinated terrorist attacks in paris and saint-denis claimed by the 'islamic state ' organisation isil ( 'daesh ' , isis ) ; 130 people were killed by gunfire and bombs , and more than 350 were injured . seven of the attackers killed themselves and others by setting off their explosive vests . on the morning of 18 november three suspected terrorists , including alleged planner of the attacks abdelhamid abaaoud , were killed in a shootout with police in the paris suburb of saint-denis . president hollande declared france to be in a three-month state of emergency .
ge has a history of some of its activities giving rise to large-scale air and water pollution . based on year 2000 data , researchers at the political economy research institute listed the corporation as the fourth-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the united states , with more than 4.4 million pounds per year ( 2,000 tons ) of toxic chemicals released into the air . ge has also been implicated in the creation of toxic waste . according to epa documents , only the united states government , honeywell , and chevron corporation are responsible for producing more superfund toxic waste sites .
traditional architecture is distinctive and include the manueline , also known as portuguese late gothic , a sumptuous , composite portuguese style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century . a 20th-century interpretation of traditional architecture , soft portuguese style , appears extensively in major cities , especially lisbon . modern portugal has given the world renowned architects like eduardo souto de moura , álvaro siza vieira ( both pritzker prize winners ) and gonçalo byrne . in portugal tomás taveira is also noteworthy , particularly for stadium design .
after the decline of aksum , the eritrean highlands were under the domain of bahr negash ruled by the bahr negus . the area was then known as ma'ikele bahr ( " between the seas/rivers , " i.e . the land between the red sea and the mereb river ) . it was later renamed under emperor zara yaqob as the domain of the bahr negash , the medri bahri ( " sea land " in tingrinya , although it included some areas like shire on the other side of the mereb , today in ethiopia ) . with its capital at debarwa , the state 's main provinces were hamasien , serae and akele guzai .
frances a. m. forbes writes that when the patriarch alexander was on his death-bed he called athanasius , who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made bishop . " when the bishops of the church assembled to elect their new patriarch , the whole catholic population surrounded the church , holding up their hands to heaven and crying ; " give us athanasius ! " the bishops had nothing better . athanasius was thus elected , as gregory tells us ... " ( pope gregory i , would have full access to the vatican archives ) .
sanctions imposed by the united states and european countries against the former military government , coupled with boycotts and other direct pressure on corporations by supporters of the democracy movement , have resulted in the withdrawal from the country of most us and many european companies . on 13 april 2012 british prime minister david cameron called for the economic sanctions on myanmar to be suspended in the wake of the pro-democracy party gaining 43 seats out of a possible 45 in the 2012 by-elections with the party leader , aung san suu kyi becoming a member of the burmese parliament .
at the 1966 " man the hunter " conference , anthropologists richard borshay lee and irven devore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population . therefore , no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member . other characteristics lee and devore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition .
his birthday ( 14 december 1895 ) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather , prince albert , the prince consort . uncertain of how the prince consort 's widow , queen victoria , would take the news of the birth , the prince of wales wrote to the duke of york that the queen had been " rather distressed " . two days later , he wrote again : " i really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name albert to her " . queen victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby albert , and wrote to the duchess of york : " i am all impatience to see the new one , born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me , especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good " . consequently , he was baptised " albert frederick arthur george " at st. mary magdalene 's church near sandringham three months later . [ a ] as a great-grandson of queen victoria , he was known formally as his highness prince albert of york from birth . within the family , he was known informally as " bertie " . his maternal grandmother , the duchess of teck , did not like the first name the baby had been given , and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name " may supplant the less favoured one " .
in 1853 , victoria gave birth to her eighth child , leopold , with the aid of the new anaesthetic , chloroform . victoria was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child , beatrice , despite opposition from members of the clergy , who considered it against biblical teaching , and members of the medical profession , who thought it dangerous . victoria may have suffered from post-natal depression after many of her pregnancies . letters from albert to victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control . for example , about a month after leopold 's birth albert complained in a letter to victoria about her " continuance of hysterics " over a " miserable trifle " .
the late jurassic archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics : teeth , clawed fingers , and a long , lizard-like tail , as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds . it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor .
by the middle ages , large numbers of jews lived in the holy roman empire and had assimilated into german culture , including many jews who had previously assimilated into french culture and had spoken a mixed judeo-french language . upon assimilating into german culture , the jewish german peoples incorporated major parts of the german language and elements of other european languages into a mixed language known as yiddish . however tolerance and assimilation of jews in german society suddenly ended during the crusades with many jews being forcefully expelled from germany and western yiddish disappeared as a language in germany over the centuries , with german jewish people fully adopting the german language .
the luftwaffe 's poor intelligence meant that their aircraft were not always able to locate their targets , and thus attacks on factories and airfields failed to achieve the desired results . british fighter aircraft production continued at a rate surpassing germany 's by 2 to 1 . the british produced 10,000 aircraft in 1940 , in comparison to germany 's 8,000 . the replacement of pilots and aircrew was more difficult . both the raf and luftwaffe struggled to replace manpower losses , though the germans had larger reserves of trained aircrew . the circumstances affected the germans more than the british . operating over home territory , british flyers could fly again if they survived being shot down . german crews , even if they survived , faced capture . moreover , bombers had four to five crewmen on board , representing a greater loss of manpower . on 7 september , the germans shifted away from the destruction of the raf 's supporting structures . german intelligence suggested fighter command was weakening , and an attack on london would force it into a final battle of annihilation while compelling the british government to surrender .
chopin 's disease and the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion . his death certificate gave the cause as tuberculosis , and his physician , jean cruveilhier , was then the leading french authority on this disease . other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis , cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency . however , the attribution of tuberculosis as principal cause of death has not been disproved . permission for dna testing , which could put the matter to rest , has been denied by the polish government .
washington university in st. louis ( wash. u. , or wustl ) is a private research university located in st. louis , missouri , united states . founded in 1853 , and named after george washington , the university has students and faculty from all 50 u.s. states and more than 120 countries . twenty-five nobel laureates have been affiliated with washington university , nine having done the major part of their pioneering research at the university . washington university 's undergraduate program is ranked 15th by u.s. news and world report . the university is ranked 32nd in the world by the academic ranking of world universities .
as an initial response , truman called for a naval blockade of north korea , and was shocked to learn that such a blockade could be imposed only 'on paper ' , since the u.s. navy no longer had the warships with which to carry out his request . in fact , because of the extensive defense cuts and the emphasis placed on building a nuclear bomber force , none of the services were in a position to make a robust response with conventional military strength . general omar bradley , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , was faced with re-organizing and deploying an american military force that was a shadow of its world war ii counterpart . the impact of the truman administration 's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt , as american troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions . lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons , artillery or armor , they were driven back down the korean peninsula to pusan . in a postwar analysis of the unpreparedness of u.s. army forces deployed to korea during the summer and fall of 1950 , army major general floyd l. parks stated that " many who never lived to tell the tale had to fight the full range of ground warfare from offensive to delaying action , unit by unit , man by man ... [ t ] hat we were able to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat ... does not relieve us from the blame of having placed our own flesh and blood in such a predicament . "
most israelis are drafted into the military at the age of 18 . men serve two years and eight months and women two years . following mandatory service , israeli men join the reserve forces and usually do up to several weeks of reserve duty every year until their forties . most women are exempt from reserve duty . arab citizens of israel ( except the druze ) and those engaged in full-time religious studies are exempt from military service , although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention in israeli society for many years . an alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is sherut leumi , or national service , which involves a program of service in hospitals , schools and other social welfare frameworks . as a result of its conscription program , the idf maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and an additional 445,000 reservists .
much of youtube 's revenue goes to the copyright holders of the videos . in 2010 it was reported that nearly a third of the videos with advertisements were uploaded without permission of the copyright holders . youtube gives an option for copyright holders to locate and remove their videos or to have them continue running for revenue . in may 2013 , nintendo began enforcing its copyright ownership and claiming the advertising revenue from video creators who posted screenshots of its games . in february 2015 , nintendo agreed to share the revenue with the video creators .
the consensus among linguists is that modern , standard czech originated during the eighteenth century . by then the language had developed a literary tradition , and since then it has changed little ; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard czech , and contemporary czechs can understand them with little difficulty . changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í ( although é survives for some uses ) and the merging of í and the former ejí . sometime before the eighteenth century , the czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in slovak .
the national incident based reporting system ( nibrs ) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in ucr data . the system is used by law enforcement agencies in the united states for collecting and reporting data on crimes . local , state , and federal agencies generate nibrs data from their records management systems . data is collected on every incident and arrest in the group a offense category . the group a offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories . specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the nibrs system . in addition to the group a offenses , eleven group b offenses are reported with only the arrest information . the nibrs system is in greater detail than the summary-based ucr system . as of 2004 , 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted nibrs data . that amount represents 20 % of the united states population and 16 % of the crime statistics data collected by the fbi .
poetry , in particular , was a staple of court life . nobles and ladies-in-waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status . every occasion could call for the writing of a verse , from the birth of a child to the coronation of an emperor , or even a pretty scene of nature . a well-written poem or haiku could easily make or break one 's reputation , and often was a key part of social interaction.almost as important was the choice of calligraphy , or handwriting , used . the japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person 's soul : therefore , poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding . whether the script was chinese or japanese , good writing and artistic skill was paramount to social reputation when it came to poetry . sei shonagon mentions in her pillow book that when a certain courtesan tried to ask her advice about how to write a poem to the empress sadako , she had to politely rebuke him because his writing was so poor .
eisenhower 's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the u.s. army 's 1919 transcontinental motor convoy . he was assigned as an observer for the mission , which involved sending a convoy of u.s. army vehicles coast to coast . his subsequent experience with encountering german autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of world war ii convinced him of the benefits of an interstate highway system . noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country , he thought an interstate highway system in the u.s. would not only be beneficial for military operations , but provide a measure of continued economic growth . the legislation initially stalled in the congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project , but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by eisenhower in june 1956 .
the bronx museum of the arts , founded in 1971 , exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and 11,000 square feet ( 1,000 m2 ) of galleries . many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the bronx . its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art , primarily by artists from africa , asia and latin america , including paintings , photographs , prints , drawings , and mixed media . the museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm arquitectonica .
there are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects . gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and diffusive ventilation , to discontinuous gas exchange . :65–68 during continuous gas exchange , oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle . in discontinuous gas exchange , however , the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest . diffusive ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen . some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration . as larvae , many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water , while others need to rise to the water surface to replenish air supplies which may be held or trapped in special structures .
some historians argue that napoleon iii also sought war , particularly for the diplomatic defeat in 1866 in leveraging any benefits from the austro-prussian war , and he believed he would win a conflict with prussia . they also argue that he wanted a war to resolve growing domestic political problems . other historians , notably french historian pierre milza , dispute this . on 8 may 1870 , shortly before the war , french voters had overwhelmingly supported napoleon iii 's program in a national plebiscite , with 7,358,000 votes yes against 1,582,000 votes no , an increase of support of two million votes since the legislative elections in 1869 . according to milza , the emperor had no need for a war to increase his popularity .
in 1941 , zuse followed his earlier machine up with the z3 , the world 's first working electromechanical programmable , fully automatic digital computer . the z3 was built with 2000 relays , implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 hz . program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard . it was quite similar to modern machines in some respects , pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers . replacement of the hard-to-implement decimal system ( used in charles babbage 's earlier design ) by the simpler binary system meant that zuse 's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable , given the technologies available at that time . the z3 was turing complete .
in the last years of the nineteenth century , planck was investigating the problem of black-body radiation first posed by kirchhoff some forty years earlier . it is well known that hot objects glow , and that hotter objects glow brighter than cooler ones . the electromagnetic field obeys laws of motion similarly to a mass on a spring , and can come to thermal equilibrium with hot atoms . the hot object in equilibrium with light absorbs just as much light as it emits . if the object is black , meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it , then its thermal light emission is maximized .
the capital and largest city is lahore which was the historical capital of the wider punjab region . other important cities include faisalabad , rawalpindi , gujranwala , sargodha , multan , sialkot , bahawalpur , gujrat , sheikhupura , jhelum and sahiwal . undivided punjab is home to six rivers , of which five flow through pakistani punjab . from west to east , these are : the indus , jhelum , beas , chenab , ravi and sutlej . nearly 60 % of pakistan 's population lives in the punjab . it is the nation 's only province that touches every other province ; it also surrounds the federal enclave of the national capital city at islamabad . in the acronym p-a-k-i-s-t-a-n , the p is for punjab .
the slave trade was engaged in by european state and non-state actors such as great britain , the netherlands , portugal and private companies , as well as various african states and non-state actors . with rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities , great britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807 . following the napoleonic wars , great britain established the west africa squadron in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves . it stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the african coast with slaves ; the seized slaves were taken to freetown , a colony in west africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from britain . britain intervened in the lagos kingship power struggle by bombarding lagos in 1851 , deposing the slave trade friendly oba kosoko , helping to install the amenable oba akitoye , and signing the treaty between great britain and lagos on 1 january 1852 . britain annexed lagos as a crown colony in august 1861 with the lagos treaty of cession . british missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland . in 1864 , samuel ajayi crowther became the first african bishop of the anglican church .
child soldiers have and continue to play a major part in the burmese army as well as burmese rebel movements . the independent reported in june 2012 that " children are being sold as conscripts into the burmese military for as little as $ 40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol . " the un 's special representative of the secretary-general for children and armed conflict , radhika coomaraswamy , who stepped down from her position a week later , met representatives of the government of myanmar on 5 july 2012 and stated that she hoped the government 's signing of an action plan would " signal a transformation . " in september 2012 , the myanmar armed forces released 42 child soldiers and the international labour organization met with representatives of the government as well as the kachin independence army to secure the release of more child soldiers . according to samantha power , a us delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in october 2012 . however , she did not comment on the government 's progress towards reform in this area .
primark continued to investigate the allegations for three years , concluding that bbc report was a fake . in 2011 , following an investigation by the bbc trust ’ s editorial standards committee , the bbc announced , " having carefully scrutinised all of the relevant evidence , the committee concluded that , on the balance of probabilities , it was more likely than not that the bangalore footage was not authentic . " bbc subsequently apologised for faking footage , and returned the television award for investigative reporting .
corruption facilitates environmental destruction . while corrupt societies may have formal legislation to protect the environment , it can not be enforced if officials can easily be bribed . the same applies to social rights worker protection , unionization prevention , and child labor . violation of these laws rights enables corrupt countries to gain illegitimate economic advantage in the international market .
if the governor general of canada is unable to give assent , it can be done by either the deputy of the governor general of canada—the chief justice of canada—or another justice of the supreme court of canada . it is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature , the signature being merely an attestation . in each case , the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law . two methods are available : the sovereign 's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament ; alternatively , each house may be notified separately , usually by the speaker of that house . however , though both houses must be notified on the same day , notice to the house of commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the journals of the house of commons , whereas the senate must be sitting and the governor general 's letter read aloud by the speaker .
approximately one-third of east prussia 's population died in the plague and famine of 1709–1711 , including the last speakers of old prussian . the plague , probably brought by foreign troops during the great northern war , killed 250,000 east prussians , especially in the province 's eastern regions . crown prince frederick william i led the rebuilding of east prussia , founding numerous towns . thousands of protestants expelled from the archbishopric of salzburg were allowed to settle in depleted east prussia . the province was overrun by imperial russian troops during the seven years ' war .
after running imperial military affairs in the states of coahuila and durango , general agustín enrique brincourt made preparations to invade the state of chihuahua . on july 8 , 1865 brincourt crossed the nazas river in northern durango , heading toward chihuahua . on july 22 brincourt crossed the banks of río florido into ciudad jiménez ; one day later he arrived at valle de allende where he sent colonel pyot with a garrison to take control of hidalgo del parral . brincourt continued through santa rosalia de camargo and santa cruz de rosales . president juárez remained in the state capital until august 5 , 1865 when he left for el paso del norte ( present-day ciudad juárez ) due to evidence that the french were to attack the city . on the same day , the president named general manuel ojinaga the new governor and placed him in charge of all the republican forces . meanwhile , general villagran surprised the imperial forces in control of hidalgo de parral ; after a short two-hour battle , colonel pyot was defeated and forced to retreat . at the battle of parral , the french lost 55 men to the republican forces . on august 13 , 1865 , the french forces with an estimated 2,500 men arrived at the outskirts of chihuahua city , and on august 15 , 1865 , general brincourt defeated the republican forces , taking control of the state capital . brincourt designated tomás zuloaga as prefect of chihuahua . fearing the french would continue their campaign to el paso del norte , president juárez relocated to el carrizal , a secluded place in the mountains near el paso del norte , in august 1865 , . it would have been easy for the french forces to continue in pursuit of president juárez across the border , but they feared altercations with american forces . general françois achille bazaine ordered the french troops to retreat back to the state of durango after only reaching a point one days travel north of chihuahua city . general brincourt asked for 1,000 men to be left behind to help maintain control over the state , but his request was denied . after the death of general ojinaga , the republican government declared general villagran in charge of the fight against the imperial forces . the french left the state on october 29 , 1865 . president juárez returned to chihuahua city on november 20 , 1865 and remained in the city until december 9 , 1865 when he returned to el paso del norte . shortly after the president left chihuahua city , terrazas was restored as governor of the state on december 11 , 1865 .
a day after announcing the attempt on his life , nasser established a new provisional constitution proclaiming a 600-member national assembly ( 400 from egypt and 200 from syria ) and the dissolution of all political parties . nasser gave each of the provinces two vice-presidents : boghdadi and amer in egypt , and sabri al-asali and akram al-hawrani in syria . nasser then left for moscow to meet with nikita khrushchev . at the meeting , khrushchev pressed nasser to lift the ban on the communist party , but nasser refused , stating it was an internal matter which was not a subject of discussion with outside powers . khrushchev was reportedly taken aback and denied he had meant to interfere in the uar 's affairs . the matter was settled as both leaders sought to prevent a rift between their two countries .
there were four major hdtv systems tested by smpte in the late 1970s , and in 1979 an smpte study group released a study of high definition television systems :
as an electro-magnetic wave travels through the different parts of the antenna system ( radio , feed line , antenna , free space ) it may encounter differences in impedance ( e/h , v/i , etc. ) . at each interface , depending on the impedance match , some fraction of the wave 's energy will reflect back to the source , forming a standing wave in the feed line . the ratio of maximum power to minimum power in the wave can be measured and is called the standing wave ratio ( swr ) . a swr of 1:1 is ideal . a swr of 1.5:1 is considered to be marginally acceptable in low power applications where power loss is more critical , although an swr as high as 6:1 may still be usable with the right equipment . minimizing impedance differences at each interface ( impedance matching ) will reduce swr and maximize power transfer through each part of the antenna system .
teenager sanjaya malakar was the season 's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo , and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog vote for the worst and satellite radio personality howard stern , who both encouraged fans to vote for him . however , on april 18 , sanjaya was voted off .
the music hall and cabaret are famous paris institutions . the moulin rouge was opened in 1889 . it was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof , and became the birthplace of the dance known as the french cancan . it helped make famous the singers mistinguett and édith piaf and the painter toulouse-lautrec , who made posters for the venue . in 1911 , the dance hall olympia paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows , competing with its great rival , the folies bergère , its stars in the 1920s included the american singer and dancer josephine baker . the casino de paris presented many famous french singers , including mistinguett , maurice chevalier , and tino rossi . other famous paris music halls include le lido , on the champs-élysées , opened in 1946 ; and the crazy horse saloon , featuring strip-tease , dance and magic , opened in 1951 . the olympia paris has presented edith piaf , marlene dietrich , miles davis , judy garland , and the grateful dead . a half dozen music halls exist today in paris , attended mostly visitors to the city .
nathan knorr was appointed as third president of the watch tower bible and tract society in 1942 . knorr commissioned a new translation of the bible , the new world translation of the holy scriptures , the full version of which was released in 1961 . he organized large international assemblies , instituted new training programs for members , and expanded missionary activity and branch offices throughout the world . knorr 's presidency was also marked by an increasing use of explicit instructions guiding witnesses in their lifestyle and conduct , and a greater use of congregational judicial procedures to enforce a strict moral code .

the luxurious and ornate representative texts of serbo-croatian church slavonic belong to the later era , when they coexisted with the serbo-croatian vernacular literature . the most notable are the " missal of duke novak " from the lika region in northwestern croatia ( 1368 ) , " evangel from reims " ( 1395 , named after the town of its final destination ) , hrvoje 's missal from bosnia and split in dalmatia ( 1404 ) , and the first printed book in serbo-croatian , the glagolitic missale romanum glagolitice ( 1483 ) .
the structure of bern 's city centre is largely medieval and has been recognised by unesco as a cultural world heritage site . perhaps its most famous sight is the zytglogge ( bernese german for " time bell " ) , an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets . it also has an impressive 15th century gothic cathedral , the münster , and a 15th-century town hall . thanks to 6 kilometres ( 4 miles ) of arcades , the old town boasts one of the longest covered shopping promenades in europe .
regular lpga tournaments are held at cedar ridge country club in tulsa , and major championships for the pga or lpga have been played at southern hills country club in tulsa , oak tree country club in oklahoma city , and cedar ridge country club in tulsa . rated one of the top golf courses in the nation , southern hills has hosted four pga championships , including one in 2007 , and three u.s . opens , the most recent in 2001 . rodeos are popular throughout the state , and guymon , in the state 's panhandle , hosts one of the largest in the nation .
the most common staple crops consumed during han were wheat , barley , foxtail millet , proso millet , rice , and beans . commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts , pears , plums , peaches , melons , apricots , strawberries , red bayberries , jujubes , calabash , bamboo shoots , mustard plant and taro . domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens , mandarin ducks , geese , cows , sheep , pigs , camels and dogs ( various types were bred specifically for food , while most were used as pets ) . turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes . commonly hunted game , such as owl , pheasant , magpie , sika deer , and chinese bamboo partridge were consumed . seasonings included sugar , honey , salt and soy sauce . beer and wine were regularly consumed .
in some fields hellenistic culture thrived , particularly in its preservation of the past . the states of the hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories . the preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature ( including the works of the three great classical tragedians , aeschylus , sophocles , and euripides ) are due to the efforts of the hellenistic greeks . the museum and library of alexandria was the center of this conservationist activity . with the support of royal stipends , alexandrian scholars collected , translated , copied , classified and critiqued every book they could find . most of the great literary figures of the hellenistic period studied at alexandria and conducted research there . they were scholar poets , writing not only poetry but treatises on homer and other archaic and classical greek literature .
some organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes : diploid , triploid , tetraploid and so on . in classical genetics , in a sexually reproducing organism ( typically eukarya ) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell . the halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis . in haploid organisms , including cells of bacteria , archaea , and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts , or viruses , that similarly contain genes , the single or set of circular or linear chains of dna ( or rna for some viruses ) , likewise constitute the genome . the term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear dna ( i.e. , the " nuclear genome " ) but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own dna , as with the " mitochondrial genome " or the " chloroplast genome " . additionally , the genome can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses , plasmids , and transposable elements .
several governments maintain permanent manned research stations on the continent . the number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer , giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres ( 180 and 900 per million square miles ) at these times . many of the stations are staffed year-round , the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment . an orthodox church—trinity church , opened in 2004 at the russian bellingshausen station—is manned year-round by one or two priests , who are similarly rotated every year .
from 1879 , watch tower supporters gathered as autonomous congregations to study the bible topically . thirty congregations were founded , and during 1879 and 1880 , russell visited each to provide the format he recommended for conducting meetings . as congregations continued to form during russell 's ministry , they each remained self-administrative , functioning under the congregationalist style of church governance . in 1881 , zion 's watch tower tract society was presided over by william henry conley , and in 1884 , charles taze russell incorporated the society as a non-profit business to distribute tracts and bibles . by about 1900 , russell had organized thousands of part- and full-time colporteurs , and was appointing foreign missionaries and establishing branch offices . by the 1910s , russell 's organization maintained nearly a hundred " pilgrims , " or traveling preachers . russell engaged in significant global publishing efforts during his ministry , and by 1912 , he was the most distributed christian author in the united states .
zakaria mohieddin , who was nasser 's vice president , said that nasser gradually changed during his reign . he ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself . although nasser repeatedly said that a war with israel will start at a time of his , or arab , choosing , on 1967 he started a bluffing game " but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding . in this case nasser 's opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces " and nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet . " all of this was out of character ... his tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes ... that was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967 " .
following the norman conquest in 1066 , southampton became the major port of transit between the then capital of england , winchester , and normandy . southampton castle was built in the 12th century and by the 13th century southampton had become a leading port , particularly involved in the import of french wine in exchange for english cloth and wool .
during the latter half of the 20th century , washington university transitioned from a strong regional university to a national research institution . in 1957 , planning began for the construction of the “ south 40 , ” a complex of modern residential halls . with the additional on-campus housing , washington university , which had been predominantly a “ streetcar college ” of commuter students , began to attract a more national pool of applicants . by 1964 , over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the st. louis area .
the samoan islands have been produced by vulcanism , the source of which is the samoa hotspot which is probably the result of a mantle plume . while all of the islands have volcanic origins , only savai'i , the western most island in samoa , is volcanically active with the most recent eruptions in mt matavanu ( 1905–1911 ) , mata o le afi ( 1902 ) and mauga afi ( 1725 ) . the highest point in samoa is mt silisili , at 1858 m ( 6,096 ft ) . the saleaula lava fields situated on the central north coast of savai'i are the result of the mt matavanu eruptions which left 50 km² ( 20 sq mi ) of solidified lava .
for over 200 years , russia had been expanding southwards across the sparsely populated " wild fields " toward the warm water ports of the black sea that did not freeze over like the handful of other ports available in the north . the goal was to promote year-round trade and a year-round navy . :11 pursuit of this goal brought the emerging russian state into conflict with the ukrainian cossacks and then with the tatars of the crimean khanate and circassians . when russia conquered these groups and gained possession of southern ukraine , known as new russia during russian imperial times , the ottoman empire lost its buffer zone against russian expansion , and russia and the ottoman empire fell into direct conflict . the conflict with the ottoman empire also presented a religious issue of importance , as russia saw itself as the protector of orthodox christians , many of whom lived under ottoman control and were treated as second-class citizens .

new haven was the host of the 1995 special olympics world summer games ; then-president bill clinton spoke at the opening ceremonies . the city is home to the pilot pen international tennis event , which takes place every august at the connecticut tennis center , one of the largest tennis venues in the world . new haven biannually hosts " the game " between yale and harvard , the country 's second-oldest college football rivalry . numerous road races take place in new haven , including the usa 20k championship during the new haven road race .
in the 5th-century ravenna , the capital of the western roman empire , became the center of late roman mosaic art . the mausoleum of galla placidia was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430 . the vaults of the small , cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background . the central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky . another great building established by galla placidia was the church of san giovanni evangelista . she erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from constantinople to ravenna . the mosaics depicted the storm , portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of ravenna , peter chrysologus . they are known only from renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747 .
the first visible-spectrum ( red ) led was developed in 1962 by nick holonyak , jr. , while working at general electric company . holonyak first reported his led in the journal applied physics letters on the december 1 , 1962 . m. george craford , a former graduate student of holonyak , invented the first yellow led and improved the brightness of red and red-orange leds by a factor of ten in 1972 . in 1976 , t. p. pearsall created the first high-brightness , high-efficiency leds for optical fiber telecommunications by inventing new semiconductor materials specifically adapted to optical fiber transmission wavelengths .
it is also known as the wenchuan earthquake ( chinese : 汶川大地震 ; pinyin : wènchuān dà dìzhèn ; literally : " great wenchuan earthquake " ) , after the location of the earthquake 's epicenter , wenchuan county , sichuan . the epicenter was 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west-northwest of chengdu , the provincial capital , with a focal depth of 19 km ( 12 mi ) . the earthquake was also felt in nearby countries and as far away as both beijing and shanghai—1,500 km ( 930 mi ) and 1,700 km ( 1,060 mi ) away—where office buildings swayed with the tremor . strong aftershocks , some exceeding magnitude 6 , continued to hit the area even months after the main quake , causing new casualties and damage .
in 1877 , john wanamaker opened the united state 's first modern department store in a former pennsylvania railroad freight terminal in philadelphia . wanamakers was the first department store to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination ( 1878 ) , the telephone ( 1879 ) , and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents ( 1880 ) to the department store business . subsequent department stores founded in philadelphia included strawbridge and clothier , gimbels , lit brothers , and snellenbergs .
as the president , tito had access to extensive ( state-owned ) property associated with the office , and maintained a lavish lifestyle . in belgrade he resided in the official residence , the beli dvor , and maintained a separate private home . the brijuni islands were the site of the state summer residence from 1949 on . the pavilion was designed by jože plečnik , and included a zoo . close to 100 foreign heads of state were to visit tito at the island residence , along with film stars such as elizabeth taylor , richard burton , sophia loren , carlo ponti , and gina lollobrigida .
in america , episcopalian dennis bennett is sometimes cited as one of the charismatic movement 's seminal influence . in the united kingdom , colin urquhart , michael harper , david watson and others were in the vanguard of similar developments . the massey conference in new zealand , 1964 was attended by several anglicans , including the rev . ray muller , who went on to invite bennett to new zealand in 1966 , and played a leading role in developing and promoting the life in the spirit seminars . other charismatic movement leaders in new zealand include bill subritzky .
eritrea 's ethnic groups each have their own styles of music and accompanying dances . amongst the tigrinya , the best known traditional musical genre is the guaila . traditional instruments of eritrean folk music include the stringed krar , kebero , begena , masenqo and the wata ( a distant/rudimentary cousin of the violin ) . the most popular eritrean artist is the tigrinya singer helen meles , who is noted for her powerful voice and wide singing range . other prominent local musicians include the kunama singer dehab faytinga , ruth abraha , bereket mengisteab , yemane baria , and the late abraham afewerki .
as is known from the " sumerian farmer 's almanac " , after the flood season and after the spring equinox and the akitu or new year festival , using the canals , farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water . next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds . they then dragged the fields with pickaxes . after drying , they plowed , harrowed , and raked the ground three times , and pulverized it with a mattock , before planting seed . unfortunately the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields . by the ur iii period , farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant barley as their principal crop .
on ancient reliefs , especially from mesopotamia , kings are often depicted as hunters of big game such as lions and are often portrayed hunting from a war chariot . the cultural and psychological importance of hunting in ancient societies is represented by deities such as the horned god cernunnos and lunar goddesses of classical antiquity , the greek artemis or roman diana . taboos are often related to hunting , and mythological association of prey species with a divinity could be reflected in hunting restrictions such as a reserve surrounding a temple . euripides ' tale of artemis and actaeon , for example , may be seen as a caution against disrespect of prey or impudent boasting .
the most extreme forms of cubism were not those practiced by picasso and braque , who resisted total abstraction . other cubists , by contrast , especially františek kupka , and those considered orphists by apollinaire ( delaunay , léger , picabia and duchamp ) , accepted abstraction by removing visible subject matter entirely . kupka ’ s two entries at the 1912 salon d'automne , amorpha-fugue à deux couleurs and amorpha chromatique chaude , were highly abstract ( or nonrepresentational ) and metaphysical in orientation . both duchamp in 1912 and picabia from 1912 to 1914 developed an expressive and allusive abstraction dedicated to complex emotional and sexual themes . beginning in 1912 delaunay painted a series of paintings entitled simultaneous windows , followed by a series entitled formes circulaires , in which he combined planar structures with bright prismatic hues ; based on the optical characteristics of juxtaposed colors his departure from reality in the depiction of imagery was quasi-complete . in 1913–14 léger produced a series entitled contrasts of forms , giving a similar stress to color , line and form . his cubism , despite its abstract qualities , was associated with themes of mechanization and modern life . apollinaire supported these early developments of abstract cubism in les peintres cubistes ( 1913 ) , writing of a new " pure " painting in which the subject was vacated . but in spite of his use of the term orphism these works were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category .
nasser 's return to egypt coincided with husni al-za'im 's syrian coup d'état . its success and evident popular support among the syrian people encouraged nasser 's revolutionary pursuits . soon after his return , he was summoned and interrogated by prime minister ibrahim abdel hadi regarding suspicions that he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers . according to secondhand reports , nasser convincingly denied the allegations . abdel hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army , especially in front of its chief of staff , who was present during the interrogation , and subsequently released nasser . the interrogation pushed nasser to speed up his group 's activities .
medieval cholas rose to prominence during the middle of the 9th century c.e . and established the greatest empire south india had seen . they successfully united the south india under their rule and through their naval strength extended their influence in the southeast asian countries such as srivijaya . under rajaraja chola i and his successors rajendra chola i , rajadhiraja chola , virarajendra chola and kulothunga chola i the dynasty became a military , economic and cultural power in south asia and south-east asia . rajendra chola i 's navies went even further , occupying the sea coasts from burma to vietnam , the andaman and nicobar islands , the lakshadweep ( laccadive ) islands , sumatra , and the malay peninsula in southeast asia and the pegu islands . the power of the new empire was proclaimed to the eastern world by the expedition to the ganges which rajendra chola i undertook and by the occupation of cities of the maritime empire of srivijaya in southeast asia , as well as by the repeated embassies to china . they dominated the political affairs of sri lanka for over two centuries through repeated invasions and occupation . they also had continuing trade contacts with the arabs in the west and with the chinese empire in the east . rajaraja chola i and his equally distinguished son rajendra chola i gave political unity to the whole of southern india and established the chola empire as a respected sea power . under the cholas , the south india reached new heights of excellence in art , religion and literature . in all of these spheres , the chola period marked the culmination of movements that had begun in an earlier age under the pallavas . monumental architecture in the form of majestic temples and sculpture in stone and bronze reached a finesse never before achieved in india .
early research into circadian rhythms suggested that most people preferred a day closer to 25 hours when isolated from external stimuli like daylight and timekeeping . however , this research was faulty because it failed to shield the participants from artificial light . although subjects were shielded from time cues ( like clocks ) and daylight , the researchers were not aware of the phase-delaying effects of indoor electric lights . [ dubious – discuss ] the subjects were allowed to turn on light when they were awake and to turn it off when they wanted to sleep . electric light in the evening delayed their circadian phase . [ citation needed ] a more stringent study conducted in 1999 by harvard university estimated the natural human rhythm to be closer to 24 hours , 11 minutes : much closer to the solar day but still not perfectly in sync .
in the 2010s , american jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs , due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume . hospira , the only u.s. manufacturer of sodium thiopental , stopped making the drug in 2011 . the european union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution ; this has prevented executioners from using eu-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes . another alternative , pentobarbital , is also only manufactured in the european union , which has caused the danish producer to restrict distribution to u.s. government customers .
education in nigeria is overseen by the ministry of education . local authorities take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled public education and state schools at a regional level . the education system is divided into kindergarten , primary education , secondary education and tertiary education . after the 1970s oil boom , tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of nigeria . 68 % of the nigerian population is literate , and the rate for men ( 75.7 % ) is higher than that for women ( 60.6 % ) .
the most common persian word is masīhī ( مسیحی ) , from arabic. , other words are nasrānī ( نصرانی ) , from syriac for " nazarene " , and tarsā ( ترسا ) , from middle persian word tarsāg , also meaning " christian " , derived from tars , meaning " fear , respect " .
the front page caused outrage in liverpool , where the paper lost more than three-quarters of its estimated 55,000 daily sales and still sells poorly in the city more than 25 years later ( around 12,000 ) . it is unavailable in many parts of the city , as many newsagents refuse to stock it . it was revealed in a documentary called alexei sayle 's liverpool , aired in september 2008 , that many liverpudlians will not even take the newspaper for free , and those who do may simply burn or tear it up . liverpudlians refer to the paper as 'the scum ' with campaigners believing it handicapped their fight for justice .
many scripts , including arabic and devanagari , have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special ligature forms . the rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex , requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ace ( arabic calligraphic engine by decotype in the 1980s and used to generate all the arabic examples in the printed editions of the unicode standard ) , which became the proof of concept for opentype ( by adobe and microsoft ) , graphite ( by sil international ) , or aat ( by apple ) .

for example , the full name of oda nobunaga would be " oda kazusanosuke saburo nobunaga " ( 織田上総介三郎信長 ) , in which " oda " is a clan or family name , " kazusanosuke " is a title of vice-governor of kazusa province , " saburo " is a formal nickname ( yobina ) , and " nobunaga " is an adult name ( nanori ) given at genpuku , the coming of age ceremony . a man was addressed by his family name and his title , or by his yobina if he did not have a title . however , the nanori was a private name that could be used by only a very few , including the emperor .
the riba is a member organisation , with 44,000 members . chartered members are entitled to call themselves chartered architects and to append the post-nominals riba after their name ; student members are not permitted to do so . formerly , fellowships of the institute were granted , although no longer ; those who continue to hold this title instead add friba .
the person or organization submits a hcp and if approved by the agency ( fws or nmfs ) , will be issued an incidental take permit ( itp ) which allows a certain number of " takes " of the listed species . the permit may be revoked at any time and can allow incidental takes for varying amounts of time . for instance , the san bruno habitat conservation plan/ incidental take permit is good for 30 years and the wal-mart store ( in florida ) permit expires after one year . because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party , it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply , such as the national environmental policy act or nepa . a notice of the permit application action is published in the federal register and a public comment period of 30 to 90 days begins .
among other things , the information management group is responsible for the conduct of electronic warfare and the protection of the armed forces ' communications and computer networks . within the group , this operational role is fulfilled by the canadian forces information operations group , headquartered at cfs leitrim in ottawa , which operates the following units : the canadian forces information operations group headquarters ( cfioghq ) , the canadian forces electronic warfare centre ( cfewc ) , the canadian forces network operation centre ( cfnoc ) , the canadian forces signals intelligence operations centre ( cfsoc ) , the canadian forces station ( cfs ) leitrim , and the 764 communications squadron . in june 2011 the canadian armed forces chief of force development announced the establishment of a new organization , the directorate of cybernetics , headed by a brigadier general , the director general cyber ( dg cyber ) . within that directorate the newly established caf cyber task force , has been tasked to design and build cyber warfare capabilities for the canadian armed forces .
nanjing is one of the most beautiful cities of mainland china with lush green parks , natural scenic lakes , small mountains , historical buildings and monuments , relics and much more , which attracts thousands of tourists every year .
in the 1890s , the recording formats of the earliest ( toy ) discs were mainly 12.5 cm ( nominally five inches ) in diameter ; by the mid-1890s , the discs were usually 7 in ( nominally 17.5 cm ) in diameter . by 1910 the 10-inch ( 25.4 cm ) record was by far the most popular standard , holding about three minutes of music or other entertainment on a side . from 1903 onwards , 12-inch records ( 30.5 cm ) were also sold commercially , mostly of classical music or operatic selections , with four to five minutes of music per side . victor , brunswick and columbia also issued 12-inch popular medleys , usually spotlighting a broadway show score . however , other sizes did appear . eight-inch discs with a 2-inch-diameter ( 51 mm ) label became popular for about a decade in britain , but they can not be played in full on most modern record players because the tone arm can not play far enough in toward the center without modification of the equipment .
in the 16th century , count hieronymus schlick of bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers ( from german thal , or nowadays usually tal , " valley " , cognate with " dale " in english ) , named for joachimstal , the valley where the silver was mined ( st. joachim 's valley , now jáchymov ; then part of the kingdom of bohemia , now part of the czech republic ) . joachimstaler was later shortened to the german taler , a word that eventually found its way into danish and swedish as daler , norwegian as dalar and daler , dutch as daler or daalder , ethiopian as ታላሪ ( talari ) , hungarian as tallér , italian as tallero , and english as dollar . alternatively , thaler is said to come from the german coin guldengroschen ( " great guilder " , being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder ) , minted from the silver from joachimsthal .
the city is home to new haven promise , a scholarship funded by yale university for students who meet the requirements . students must be enrolled in a public high school ( charters included ) for four years , be a resident of the city during that time , carry a 3.0 cumulative grade-point average , have a 90-percent attendance rate and perform 40 hours of service to the city . the initiative was launched in 2010 and there are currently more than 500 scholars enrolled in qualifying connecticut colleges and universities . there are more than 60 cities in the country that have a promise-type program for their students .
a few special additions enhance the language-learning experience . for example , byu 's international cinema , featuring films in several languages , is the largest and longest-running university-run foreign film program in the country . as already noted , byu also offers an intensive foreign language living experience , the foreign language student residence . this is an on-campus apartment complex where students commit to speak only their chosen foreign language while in their apartments . each apartment has at least one native speaker to ensure correct language usage .
luminous efficacy of a light source may be defined in two ways . the radiant luminous efficacy ( ler ) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted ( the luminous flux ) to the total power radiated over all wavelengths . the source luminous efficacy ( les ) is the ratio of the visible light flux emitted ( the luminous flux ) to the total power input to the source , such as a lamp . visible light is measured in lumens , a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light . not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye ; the luminous efficacy of radiant energy ( ler ) is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye . the units of luminous efficacy are " lumens per watt " ( lpw ) . the maximum ler possible is 683 lm/w for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength , the peak sensitivity of the human eye .
a great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale . great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength , as well as diplomatic and soft power influence , which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers ' opinions before taking actions of their own . international relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities , spatial aspects , and status dimensions . sometimes the status of great powers is formally recognized in conferences such as the congress of vienna or an international structure such as the united nations security council ( china , france , russia , the united kingdom and the united states serve as the body 's five permanent members ) . at the same time the status of great powers can be informally recognized in a forum such as the g7 which consists of canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united kingdom and the united states of america .
between 1631 and 1890 , the city tripled its area through land reclamation by filling in marshes , mud flats , and gaps between wharves along the waterfront . the largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century ; beginning in 1807 , the crown of beacon hill was used to fill in a 50-acre ( 20 ha ) mill pond that later became the haymarket square area . the present-day state house sits atop this lowered beacon hill . reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the south end , the west end , the financial district , and chinatown . after the great boston fire of 1872 , workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront . during the mid-to-late 19th century , workers filled almost 600 acres ( 2.4 km2 ) of brackish charles river marshlands west of boston common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of needham heights . the city annexed the adjacent towns of south boston ( 1804 ) , east boston ( 1836 ) , roxbury ( 1868 ) , dorchester ( including present day mattapan and a portion of south boston ) ( 1870 ) , brighton ( including present day allston ) ( 1874 ) , west roxbury ( including present day jamaica plain and roslindale ) ( 1874 ) , charlestown ( 1874 ) , and hyde park ( 1912 ) . other proposals , for the annexation of brookline , cambridge , and chelsea , were unsuccessful .
alexander graham bell ( march 3 , 1847 – august 2 , 1922 ) was a scottish-born [ n 3 ] scientist , inventor , engineer and innovator who is credited with patenting the first practical telephone .
hellenistic culture was at its height of world influence in the hellenistic period . hellenism or at least philhellenism reached most regions on the frontiers of the hellenistic kingdoms . though some of these regions were not ruled by greeks or even greek speaking elites , certain hellenistic influences can be seen in the historical record and material culture of these regions . other regions had established contact with greek colonies before this period , and simply saw a continued process of hellenization and intermixing .
it is not clear exactly where collegiate a cappella began . the rensselyrics of rensselaer polytechnic institute ( formerly known as the rpi glee club ) , established in 1873 is perhaps the oldest known collegiate a cappella group . [ citation needed ] however the longest continuously-singing group is probably the whiffenpoofs of yale university , which was formed in 1909 and once included cole porter as a member . collegiate a cappella groups grew throughout the 20th century . some notable historical groups formed along the way include princeton university 's tigertones ( 1946 ) , colgate university 's the colgate 13 ( 1942 ) , dartmouth college 's aires ( 1946 ) , cornell university 's cayuga 's waiters ( 1949 ) and the hangovers ( 1968 ) , the university of maine maine steiners ( 1958 ) , the columbia university kingsmen ( 1949 ) , the jabberwocks of brown university ( 1949 ) , and the university of rochester yellowjackets ( 1956 ) . all-women a cappella groups followed shortly , frequently as a parody of the men 's groups : the smiffenpoofs of smith college ( 1936 ) , the shwiffs of connecticut college ( the she-whiffenpoofs , 1944 ) , and the chattertocks of brown university ( 1951 ) . a cappella groups exploded in popularity beginning in the 1990s , fueled in part by a change in style popularized by the tufts university beelzebubs and the boston university dear abbeys . the new style used voices to emulate modern rock instruments , including vocal percussion/ " beatboxing " . some larger universities now have multiple groups . groups often join one another in on-campus concerts , such as the georgetown chimes ' cherry tree massacre , a 3-weekend a cappella festival held each february since 1975 , where over a hundred collegiate groups have appeared , as well as international quartet champions the boston common and the contemporary commercial a cappella group rockapella . co-ed groups have produced many up-and-coming and major artists , including john legend , an alumnus of the counterparts at the university of pennsylvania , and sara bareilles , an alumna of awaken a cappella at university of california , los angeles . mira sorvino is an alumna of the harvard-radcliffe veritones of harvard college where she had the solo on only you by yaz .
process theology typically stresses god 's relational nature . rather than seeing god as impassive or emotionless , process theologians view god as " the fellow sufferer who understands " , and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events . hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in god ? instead , as the being who is most affected by the world , god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world . however , process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways . c. robert mesle , for instance , advocates a " process naturalism " , i.e . a process theology without god .
in the semiconductor industry , infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures . by measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer , the index of refraction ( n ) and the extinction coefficient ( k ) can be determined via the forouhi-bloomer dispersion equations . the reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension , depth , and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures .
after several years of economic downturn and political instability , in 1997 , guinea-bissau entered the cfa franc monetary system , bringing about some internal monetary stability . the civil war that took place in 1998 and 1999 , and a military coup in september 2003 again disrupted economic activity , leaving a substantial part of the economic and social infrastructure in ruins and intensifying the already widespread poverty . following the parliamentary elections in march 2004 and presidential elections in july 2005 , the country is trying to recover from the long period of instability , despite a still-fragile political situation .
a reference simulation software implementation , written in the c language and later known as iso 11172-5 , was developed ( in 1991–1996 ) by the members of the iso mpeg audio committee in order to produce bit compliant mpeg audio files ( layer 1 , layer 2 , layer 3 ) . it was approved as a committee draft of iso/iec technical report in march 1994 and printed as document cd 11172-5 in april 1994 . it was approved as a draft technical report ( dtr/dis ) in november 1994 , finalized in 1996 and published as international standard iso/iec tr 11172-5:1998 in 1998 . the reference software in c language was later published as a freely available iso standard . working in non-real time on a number of operating systems , it was able to demonstrate the first real time hardware decoding ( dsp based ) of compressed audio . some other real time implementation of mpeg audio encoders were available for the purpose of digital broadcasting ( radio dab , television dvb ) towards consumer receivers and set top boxes .
during victoria 's first pregnancy in 1840 , in the first few months of the marriage , 18-year-old edward oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in a carriage with prince albert on her way to visit her mother . oxford fired twice , but either both bullets missed or , as he later claimed , the guns had no shot . he was tried for high treason and found guilty , but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity . in the immediate aftermath of the attack , victoria 's popularity soared , mitigating residual discontent over the hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis . her daughter , also named victoria , was born on 21 november 1840 . the queen hated being pregnant , viewed breast-feeding with disgust , and thought newborn babies were ugly . nevertheless , over the following seventeen years , she and albert had a further eight children : albert edward , prince of wales ( b . 1841 ) , alice ( b . 1843 ) , alfred ( b . 1844 ) , helena ( b . 1846 ) , louise ( b . 1848 ) , arthur ( b . 1850 ) , leopold ( b . 1853 ) and beatrice ( b . 1857 ) .
in july 1855 , the allied squadron tried to go past taganrog to rostov on don , entering the don river through the mius river . on 12 july 1855 hms jasper grounded near taganrog thanks to a fisherman who moved buoys into shallow water . the cossacks captured the gunboat with all of its guns and blew it up . the third siege attempt was made 19–31 august 1855 , but the city was already fortified and the squadron could not approach close enough for landing operations . the allied fleet left the gulf of taganrog on the 2nd september 1855 , with minor military operations along the azov sea coast continuing until late autumn 1855 .
judging by the historical records , by approximately 1000 ad the predominant ethnic group over much of modern european russia , ukraine and belarus was the eastern branch of the slavs , speaking a closely related group of dialects . the political unification of this region into kievan rus ' in about 880 , from which modern russia , ukraine and belarus trace their origins , established old east slavic as a literary and commercial language . it was soon followed by the adoption of christianity in 988 and the introduction of the south slavic old church slavonic as the liturgical and official language . borrowings and calques from byzantine greek began to enter the old east slavic and spoken dialects at this time , which in their turn modified the old church slavonic as well .
bond disobeys m 's order and travels to rome to attend sciarra 's funeral . that evening he visits sciarra 's widow lucia , who tells him about spectre , a criminal organisation to which her husband belonged . bond infiltrates a spectre meeting , where he identifies the leader , franz oberhauser . when oberhauser addresses bond by name , he escapes and is pursued by mr. hinx , a spectre assassin . moneypenny informs bond that the information he collected leads to mr. white , former member of quantum , a subsidiary of spectre . bond asks her to investigate oberhauser , who was presumed dead years earlier .
however , in english , the term madrasah usually refers to the specifically islamic institutions . a typical islamic school usually offers two courses of study : a ḥifẓ course teaching memorization of the qur'an ( the person who commits the entire qurʼan to memory is called a ḥāfiẓ ) ; and an ʻālim course leading the candidate to become an accepted scholar in the community . a regular curriculum includes courses in arabic , tafsir ( qur'anic interpretation ) , sharīʻah ( islamic law ) , hadiths ( recorded sayings and deeds of muhammad ) , mantiq ( logic ) , and muslim history . in the ottoman empire , during the early modern period , the study of hadiths was introduced by süleyman i . depending on the educational demands , some madaris also offer additional advanced courses in arabic literature , english and other foreign languages , as well as science and world history . ottoman madaris along with religious teachings also taught " styles of writing , grammary , syntax , poetry , composition , natural sciences , political sciences , and etiquette . "
in britain , further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal . house and rave clubs such as lakota and cream emerged across britain , hosting house and dance scene events . the 'chilling out ' concept developed in britain with ambient house albums such as the klf 's chill out and analogue bubblebath by aphex twin . the godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90 's rave scene . after initially hosting small nights in cambridge and northampton , the associated events scaled up in milton keynes , birmingham and leeds . a new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90 's . in new york , bands such as deee-lite furthered house 's international influence . two distinctive tracks from this era were the orb 's " little fluffy clouds " ( with a distinctive vocal sample from rickie lee jones ) and the happy mondays ' " wrote for luck " ( " wfl " ) which was transformed into a dance hit by vince clarke .
serious american students of theology and divinity , particularly in new england , regarded hebrew as a classical language , along with greek and latin , and essential for study of the old testament in the original words . the reverend ezra stiles , president of the college from 1778 to 1795 , brought with him his interest in the hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient biblical texts in their original language ( as was common in other schools ) , requiring all freshmen to study hebrew ( in contrast to harvard , where only upperclassmen were required to study the language ) and is responsible for the hebrew phrase אורים ותמים ( urim and thummim ) on the yale seal . stiles ' greatest challenge occurred in july 1779 when hostile british forces occupied new haven and threatened to raze the college . however , yale graduate edmund fanning , secretary to the british general in command of the occupation , interceded and the college was saved . fanning later was granted an honorary degree ll.d. , at 1803 , for his efforts .
lateral-cut disc records were developed in the united states by emile berliner , who named his system the " gramophone " , distinguishing it from edison 's wax cylinder " phonograph " and columbia 's wax cylinder " graphophone " . berliner 's earliest discs , first marketed in 1889 , but only in europe , were 5 inches ( 13 cm ) in diameter , and were played with a small hand-propelled machine . both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity , due to the limited sound quality . in the united states in 1894 , under the berliner gramophone trademark , berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value , along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them . berliner 's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders , but his manufacturing associate eldridge r. johnson eventually improved the sound quality . abandoning berliner 's " gramophone " trademark for legal reasons , in 1901 johnson 's and berliner 's separate companies reorganized to form the victor talking machine company , whose products would come to dominate the market for many years . emile berliner moved his company to montreal in 1900 . the factory which became rca victor stills exists . there is a dedicated museum in montreal for berliner .
liberia 's highest judicial authority is the supreme court , made up of five members and headed by the chief justice of liberia . members are nominated to the court by the president and are confirmed by the senate , serving until the age of 70 . the judiciary is further divided into circuit and speciality courts , magistrate courts and justices of the peace . the judicial system is a blend of common law , based on anglo-american law , and customary law . an informal system of traditional courts still exists within the rural areas of the country , with trial by ordeal remaining common despite being officially outlawed .
gaddafi married his first wife , fatiha al-nuri , in 1969 . she was the daughter of general khalid , a senior figure in king idris ' administration , and was from a middle-class background . although they had one son , muhammad gaddafi ( b . 1970 ) , their relationship was strained , and they divorced in 1970 . gaddafi 's second wife was safia farkash , née el-brasai , a former nurse from obeidat tribe born in bayda . they met in 1969 , following his ascension to power , when he was hospitalized with appendicitis ; he claimed that it was love at first sight . the couple remained married until his death . together they had seven biological children : saif al-islam gaddafi ( b . 1972 ) , al-saadi gaddafi ( b . 1973 ) , mutassim gaddafi ( 1974–2011 ) , hannibal muammar gaddafi ( b . 1975 ) , ayesha gaddafi ( b . 1976 ) , saif al-arab gaddafi ( 1982–2011 ) , and khamis gaddafi ( 1983–2011 ) . he also adopted two children , hanna gaddafi and milad gaddafi .
perceived sexual orientation may affect how a person is treated . for instance , in the united states , the fbi reported that 15.6 % of hate crimes reported to police in 2004 were " because of a sexual-orientation bias " . under the uk employment equality ( sexual orientation ) regulations 2003 , as explained by advisory , conciliation and arbitration service , " workers or job applicants must not be treated less favourably because of their sexual orientation , their perceived sexual orientation or because they associate with someone of a particular sexual orientation " .
in the first 200 years that black people were in the united states , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . individuals identified themselves , for example , as ashanti , igbo , bakongo , or wolof . however , when the first captives were brought to the americas , they were often combined with other groups from west africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by english colonists . in areas of the upper south , different ethnic groups were brought together . this is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the west african coastline stretching from senegal to angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as mozambique . a new african-american identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of european cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the black church and black english . this new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] by contrast , slave records from louisiana show that the french and spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the west africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
the first generation ipod nano may overheat and pose a health and safety risk . affected ipod nanos were sold between september 2005 and december 2006 . this is due to a flawed battery used by apple from a single battery manufacturer . apple recommended that owners of affected ipod nanos stop using them . under an apple product replacement program , affected nanos were replaced with current generation nanos free of charge .
internet service providers in many countries are legally required ( e.g. , via communications assistance for law enforcement act ( calea ) in the u.s. ) to allow law enforcement agencies to monitor some or all of the information transmitted by the isp . furthermore , in some countries isps are subject to monitoring by intelligence agencies . in the u.s. , a controversial national security agency program known as prism provides for broad monitoring of internet users traffic and has raised concerns about potential violation of the privacy protections in the fourth amendment to the united states constitution . modern isps integrate a wide array of surveillance and packet sniffing equipment into their networks , which then feeds the data to law-enforcement/intelligence networks ( such as dcsnet in the united states , or sorm in russia ) allowing monitoring of internet traffic in real time .
societies tend to come and go , of course , depending on the special enthusiasms of the masters and boys in the school at the time , but some have been in existence many years . those in existence at present include : aeronautical , african , alexander cozens ( art ) , amnesty , archeological , architectural , astronomy , banks ( conservation ) , caledonian , cheese , classical , comedy , cosmopolitan , debating , design , entrepreneurship , geographical , henry fielding , hispanic , history , keynes ( economics ) , law , literary , mathematical , medical , middle eastern , model united nations , modern languages , oriental , orwell ( left-wing ) , simeon ( christian ) , parry ( music ) , photographic , political , praed ( poetry ) , rock ( music ) , rous ( equestrian ) , salisbury ( diplomatic ) , savile ( rare books and manuscripts ) , shelley , scientific , sports , tech club , theatre , wellington ( military ) , wine and wotton ’ s ( philosophy ) .
the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 ce , when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes . yellow glass with 1 % uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples , italy , by r. t. gunther of the university of oxford in 1912 . starting in the late middle ages , pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal , bohemia ( now jáchymov in the czech republic ) , and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry . in the early 19th century , the world 's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines .
nontrinitarians , such as unitarians , christadelphians and jehovah 's witnesses also acknowledge mary as the biological mother of jesus christ , but do not recognise marian titles such as " mother of god " as these groups generally reject christ 's divinity . since nontrinitarian churches are typically also mortalist , the issue of praying to mary , whom they would consider " asleep " , awaiting resurrection , does not arise . emanuel swedenborg says god as he is in himself could not directly approach evil spirits to redeem those spirits without destroying them ( exodus 33:20 , john 1:18 ) , so god impregnated mary , who gave jesus christ access to the evil heredity of the human race , which he could approach , redeem and save .
it is the most widely used vaccine worldwide , with more than 90 % of all children being vaccinated . the immunity it induces decreases after about ten years . as tuberculosis is uncommon in most of canada , the united kingdom , and the united states , bcg is administered only to those people at high risk . part of the reasoning against the use of the vaccine is that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive , reducing the test 's use in screening . a number of new vaccines are currently in development .
through most of shell 's early history , the shell oil company business in the united states was substantially independent with its stock being traded on the nyse and with little direct involvement from the group 's central offices in the running of the american business . however , in 1984 , royal dutch shell made a bid to purchase those shares of shell oil company it did not own ( around 30 % ) and despite opposition from some minority shareholders , which led to a court case , shell completed the buyout for a sum of $ 5.7 billion .
due to many centuries of intensive settlement , most of the area is shaped by human influence . the original natural vegetation of thuringia is forest with beech as its predominant species , as can still be found in the hainich mountains today . in the uplands , a mixture of beech and spruce would be natural . however , most of the plains have been cleared and are in intensive agricultural use while most of the forests are planted with spruce and pine . since 1990 , thuringia 's forests have been managed aiming for a more natural and tough vegetation more resilient to climate change as well as diseases and vermin . in comparison to the forest , agriculture is still quite conventional and dominated by large structures and monocultures . problems here are caused especially by increasingly prolonged dry periods during the summer months .
the economic structure of the empire was defined by its geopolitical structure . the ottoman empire stood between the west and the east , thus blocking the land route eastward and forcing spanish and portuguese navigators to set sail in search of a new route to the orient . the empire controlled the spice route that marco polo once used . when vasco da gama bypassed ottoman controlled routes and established direct trade links with india in 1498 , and christopher columbus first journeyed to the bahamas in 1492 , the ottoman empire was at its zenith .
miami international airport and portmiami are among the nation 's busiest ports of entry , especially for cargo from south america and the caribbean . the port of miami is the world 's busiest cruise port , and mia is the busiest airport in florida , and the largest gateway between the united states and latin america . additionally , the city has the largest concentration of international banks in the country , primarily along brickell avenue in brickell , miami 's financial district . due to its strength in international business , finance and trade , many international banks have offices in downtown such as espírito santo financial group , which has its u.s. headquarters in miami . miami was also the host city of the 2003 free trade area of the americas negotiations , and is one of the leading candidates to become the trading bloc 's headquarters .
the neolithic 1 ( ppna ) period began roughly 10,000 years ago in the levant . a temple area in southeastern turkey at göbekli tepe dated around 9,500 bc may be regarded as the beginning of the period . this site was developed by nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes , evidenced by the lack of permanent housing in the vicinity and may be the oldest known human-made place of worship . at least seven stone circles , covering 25 acres ( 10 ha ) , contain limestone pillars carved with animals , insects , and birds . stone tools were used by perhaps as many as hundreds of people to create the pillars , which might have supported roofs . other early ppna sites dating to around 9,500 to 9,000 bce have been found in jericho , israel ( notably ain mallaha , nahal oren , and kfar hahoresh ) , gilgal in the jordan valley , and byblos , lebanon . the start of neolithic 1 overlaps the tahunian and heavy neolithic periods to some degree .

there is very little voice acting in the game , as is the case in most zelda titles to date . link remains silent in conversation , but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised . his emotions and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions . other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations , including laughter , surprised or fearful exclamations , and screams . the character of midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialog is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech , which was produced by scrambling the phonemes of english phrases [ better source needed ] sampled by japanese voice actress akiko kōmoto .
friederike müller , a pupil of chopin , wrote : " [ his ] playing was always noble and beautiful ; his tones sang , whether in full forte or softest piano . he took infinite pains to teach his pupils this legato , cantabile style of playing . his most severe criticism was 'he—or she—does not know how to join two notes together . ' he also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm . he hated all lingering and dragging , misplaced rubatos , as well as exaggerated ritardandos ... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works .

credentials are typically conferred at the undergraduate level , however university-affiliated schools like the école de technologie supérieure and the école polytechnique de montréal ( both of which are located in quebec ) , also offer graduate and postgraduate programs , in accordance with provincial higher education guidelines . canadian higher education institutions , at all levels , undertake directed and applied research with financing allocated through public funding , private equity , or industry sources .
starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s , gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska . alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 . alaska 's capital , which had been in sitka until 1906 , was moved north to juneau . construction of the alaska governor 's mansion began that same year . european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska , where they entered the fishing and logging industries .
in addition , most grand lodges require the candidate to declare a belief in a supreme being . in a few cases , the candidate may be required to be of a specific religion . the form of freemasonry most common in scandinavia ( known as the swedish rite ) , for example , accepts only christians . at the other end of the spectrum , " liberal " or continental freemasonry , exemplified by the grand orient de france , does not require a declaration of belief in any deity , and accepts atheists ( a cause of discord with the rest of freemasonry ) .
during much of its history , and especially during the francoist dictatorship ( 1939–1975 ) , the catalan language has often been degraded as a mere dialect of spanish . this view , based on political and ideological considerations , has no linguistic validity . spanish and catalan have important differences in their sound systems , lexicon , and grammatical features , placing the language in a number of respects closer to occitan ( and french ) .
in international law and international relations , a protocol is generally a treaty or international agreement that supplements a previous treaty or international agreement . a protocol can amend the previous treaty , or add additional provisions . parties to the earlier agreement are not required to adopt the protocol . sometimes this is made clearer by calling it an " optional protocol " , especially where many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol .
capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor equation in a number of ways . some of these , such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear , or can be assumed to be linear , and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of the capacitor . the usual methods of network analysis can then be applied . in other cases , such as with breakdown voltage , the effect is non-linear and normal ( i.e. , linear ) network analysis can not be used , the effect must be dealt with separately . there is yet another group , which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant . such an example is temperature dependence . finally , combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance , resistance , or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation .
insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants . plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects , in turn , evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins . many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators . such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors . this successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics . over time , this has led to complex groups of coevolved species . conversely , some interactions between plants and insects , like pollination , are beneficial to both organisms . coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems .
the avl , created by the valencian parliament , is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of valencian , and its standard is based on the norms of castelló ( normes de castelló ) . currently , everyone who writes in valencian uses this standard , except the royal academy of valencian culture ( acadèmia de cultura valenciana , racv ) , which uses for valencian an independent standard .
bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century . although widely used for a time , it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed oil , varnish and turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact . the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is théodore géricault 's raft of the medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle .
strong aftershocks continued to strike even months after the main quake . on may 25 , an aftershock of 6.0 mw ( 6.4 ms according to cea ) hit northeast of the original earthquake 's epicenter , in qingchuan county , sichuan , causing eight deaths , 1000 injuries , and destroying thousands of buildings . on may 27 , two aftershocks , one 5.2 mw in qingchuan county and one 5.7 mw in ningqiang county , shaanxi , led to the collapse of more than 420,000 homes and injured 63 people . the same area suffered two more aftershocks of 5.6 and 6.0 ms ( 5.8 and 5.5 mw , respectively , according to usgs ) on july 23 , resulting in 1 death , 6 serious injuries , collapse of hundreds of homes and damaging kilometers of highways . pingwu county and beichuan county , sichuan , also northeast of wenchuan and close to the epicenter of a 7.2 ms earthquake in 1976 , suffered a 6.1 ms aftershock ( 5.7 mw according to usgs ) on august 1 ; it caused 2 deaths , 345 injuries , collapse of 707 homes , damages to over 1,000 homes , and blocked 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) of country roads . as late as august 5 , yet another aftershock of 6.1 ms ( 6.2 mw according to usgs ) hit qingchuan , sichuan , causing 1 death , 32 injuries , telecommunication interruptions , and widespread hill slides blocking roads in the area including a national highway .
accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour . in some countries , government policy contributes to this difficulty . for example , the overall extent of child labour in china is unclear due to the government categorizing child labour data as “ highly secret ” . china has enacted regulations to prevent child labour ; still , the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within china , generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises . in 2014 , the u.s. department of labor issued a list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor where china was attributed 12 goods the majority of which were produced by both underage children and indentured labourers . the report listed electronics , garments , toys and coal among other goods .
in the 2nd century ce , mahayana sutras spread to china , and then to korea and japan , and were translated into chinese . during the indian period of esoteric buddhism ( from the 8th century onwards ) , buddhism spread from india to tibet and mongolia .
the dirección nacional de transporte ( dnt ) , part of the national ministry of transport and public works , is responsible for the organization and development of montevideo 's transport infrastructure . a bus service network covers the entire city . an international bus station , the tres cruces bus terminal , is located on the lower level of the tres cruces shopping center , on the side of artigas boulevard . this terminal , along with the baltazar brum bus terminal ( or rio branco terminal ) by the port of montevideo , handles the long distance and intercity bus routes connecting to destinations within uruguay .
aburish asserts that nasser was not distressed by his frequent relocations , which broadened his horizons and showed him egyptian society 's class divisions . his own social status was well below the wealthy egyptian elite , and his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime . nasser spent most of his spare time reading , particularly in 1933 when he lived near the national library of egypt . he read the qur'an , the sayings of muhammad , the lives of the sahaba ( muhammad 's companions ) , and the biographies of nationalist leaders napoleon , ataturk , otto von bismarck , and garibaldi and the autobiography of winston churchill .
often , the migration route of a long-distance migrator bird does n't follow a straight line between breeding and wintering grounds . rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with detours around geographical barriers . for most land-birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stopover or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad-winged birds .
anti-government protests in 1991 led to a coup , a transitional government , and a new constitution . opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of general moussa traoré grew during the 1980s . during this time strict programs , imposed to satisfy demands of the international monetary fund , brought increased hardship upon the country 's population , while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth . peaceful student protests in january 1991 were brutally suppressed , with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants . scattered acts of rioting and vandalism of public buildings followed , but most actions by the dissidents remained nonviolent .
the 1989 film back to the future part ii depicts the chicago cubs defeating a baseball team from miami in the 2015 world series , ending the longest championship drought in all four of the major north american professional sports leagues . in 2015 , the miami marlins failed to make the playoffs and were able to make it to the 2015 national league wild card round and move on to the 2015 national league championship series by october 21 , 2015 , the date where protagonist marty mcfly traveled to the future in the film . however , it was on october 21 that the cubs were swept by the new york mets in the nlcs .
in the treaty of paris after the revolution , the british had ceded the lands between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river to the united states , without consulting the shawnee , cherokee , choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there . because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the british , the united states compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties , and began dividing these lands for settlement . this provoked a war in the northwest territory in which the u.s. forces performed poorly ; the battle of the wabash in 1791 was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the united states at the hands of american indians . president washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region , which decisively defeated the indian confederacy at the battle of fallen timbers in 1794 .
seven clubs have won the fa cup as part of a league and cup double , namely preston north end ( 1889 ) , aston villa ( 1897 ) , tottenham hotspur ( 1961 ) , arsenal ( 1971 , 1998 , 2002 ) , liverpool ( 1986 ) , manchester united ( 1994 , 1996 , 1999 ) and chelsea ( 2010 ) . in 1993 , arsenal became the first side to win both the fa cup and the league cup in the same season when they beat sheffield wednesday 2–1 in both finals . liverpool ( in 2001 ) and chelsea ( in 2007 ) have since repeated this feat . in 2012 , chelsea accomplished a different cup double consisting of the fa cup and the 2012 champions league . in 1998–99 , manchester united added the 1999 champions league title to their league and cup double to complete a unique treble . two years later , in 2000–01 , liverpool won the fa cup , league cup and uefa cup to complete a cup treble . an english treble has never been achieved .
the liberals ' immediate predecessor was the united australia party ( uap ) . more broadly , the liberal party 's ideological ancestry stretched back to the anti-labor groupings in the first commonwealth parliaments . the commonwealth liberal party was a fusion of the free trade party and the protectionist party in 1909 by the second prime minister , alfred deakin , in response to labor 's growing electoral prominence . the commonwealth liberal party merged with several labor dissidents ( including billy hughes ) to form the nationalist party of australia in 1917 . that party , in turn , merged with labor dissidents to form the uap in 1931 .
excess water intake , without replenishment of sodium and potassium salts , leads to hyponatremia , which can further lead to water intoxication at more dangerous levels . a well-publicized case occurred in 2007 , when jennifer strange died while participating in a water-drinking contest . more usually , the condition occurs in long-distance endurance events ( such as marathon or triathlon competition and training ) and causes gradual mental dulling , headache , drowsiness , weakness , and confusion ; extreme cases may result in coma , convulsions , and death . the primary damage comes from swelling of the brain , caused by increased osmosis as blood salinity decreases . effective fluid replacement techniques include water aid stations during running/cycling races , trainers providing water during team games , such as soccer , and devices such as camel baks , which can provide water for a person without making it too hard to drink the water .
laserdisc was a composite video format : the luminance ( black and white ) and chrominance ( color ) information were transmitted in one signal , separated by the receiver . while good comb filters can do so adequately , these two signals can not be completely separated . on dvds , data is stored in the form of digital blocks which make up each independent frame . the signal produced is dependent on the equipment used to master the disc . signals range from composite and split , to yuv and rgb . depending upon which format is used , this can result in far higher fidelity , particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail ( especially if there is moderate movement in the picture ) and low-contrast details like skin tones , where comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail .
on december 8 , the leaders of russia , ukraine , and belarus secretly met in belavezhskaya pushcha , in western belarus , and signed the belavezha accords , which proclaimed the soviet union had ceased to exist and announced formation of the commonwealth of independent states ( cis ) as a looser association to take its place . they also invited other republics to join the cis . gorbachev called it an unconstitutional coup . however , by this time there was no longer any reasonable doubt that , as the preamble of the accords put it , " the ussr , as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality , is ceasing its existence . "
the western emperor gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the vestals . theodosius i briefly re-united the empire : in 391 he officially adopted nicene christianity as the imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . he not only refused to restore victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the sacred fire of the vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by quintus aurelius symmachus to the western and eastern emperors . ambrose , the influential bishop of milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of symmachus 's request for tolerance . yet theodosius accepted comparison with hercules and jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly hellenic senate in traditional hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] he was the last emperor of both east and west .
the greek men 's national volleyball team has won two bronze medals , one in the european volleyball championship and another one in the european volleyball league , a 5th place in the olympic games and a 6th place in the fivb volleyball men 's world championship . the greek league , the a1 ethniki , is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in europe and the greek clubs have made significant success in european competitions . olympiacos is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only greek club to have won european titles ; they have won two cev cups , they have been cev champions league runners-up twice and they have played in as many as 12 final fours in the european competitions , making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in europe . iraklis have also seen significant success in european competitions , having been three times runners-up of the cev champions league .
a few centuries later , coinciding with the first waves of the invading germanic peoples ( suevi , vandals and alans , and later the visigoths ) and the power vacuum left by the demise of the roman imperial administration , the church assumed the reins of power in the city and replaced the old roman temples with religious buildings . with the byzantine invasion of the southwestern iberian peninsula in 554 the city acquired strategic importance . after the expulsion of the byzantines in 625 , visigothic military contingents were posted there and the ancient roman amphitheatre was fortified . little is known of its history for nearly a hundred years ; although this period is only scarcely documented by archeology , excavations suggest that there was little development of the city . during visigothic times valencia was an episcopal see of the catholic church , albeit a suffragan diocese subordinate to the archdiocese of toledo , comprising the ancient roman province of carthaginensis in hispania .
napoléon bonaparte ( /nəˈpoʊliən , -ˈpoʊljən/ ; french : [ napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt ] , born napoleone di buonaparte ; 15 august 1769 – 5 may 1821 ) was a french military and political leader who rose to prominence during the french revolution and led several successful campaigns during the revolutionary wars . as napoleon i , he was emperor of the french from 1804 until 1814 , and again in 1815 . napoleon dominated european and global affairs for more than a decade while leading france against a series of coalitions in the napoleonic wars . he won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over continental europe before its final collapse in 1815 . often considered one of the greatest commanders in history , his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . he also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in western history . in civil affairs , napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered , especially the low countries , switzerland , and large parts of modern italy and germany . he implemented fundamental liberal policies in france and throughout western europe . [ note 1 ] his lasting legal achievement , the napoleonic code , has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world 's legal systems , from japan to quebec .
the company , which benefited from the imperial patronage , soon expanded its commercial trading operations , eclipsing the portuguese estado da índia , which had established bases in goa , chittagong , and bombay , which portugal later ceded to england as part of the dowry of catherine de braganza . the east india company also launched a joint attack with the dutch united east india company on portuguese and spanish ships off the coast of china , which helped secure their ports in china . the company established trading posts in surat ( 1619 ) , madras ( 1639 ) , bombay ( 1668 ) , and calcutta ( 1690 ) . by 1647 , the company had 23 factories , each under the command of a factor or master merchant and governor if so chosen , and 90 employees in india . the major factories became the walled forts of fort william in bengal , fort st george in madras , and bombay castle .
the 1961 eruption of queen mary 's peak forced the evacuation of the entire population via cape town to england . the following year a royal society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage , and reported that the settlement of edinburgh of the seven seas had been only marginally affected . most families returned in 1963 .
yale 's museum collections are also of international stature . the yale university art gallery , the country 's first university-affiliated art museum , contains more than 180,000 works , including old masters and important collections of modern art , in the swartout and kahn buildings . the latter , louis kahn 's first large-scale american work ( 1953 ) , was renovated and reopened in december 2006 . the yale center for british art , the largest collection of british art outside of the uk , grew from a gift of paul mellon and is housed in another kahn-designed building .
mammals include the largest animals on the planet , the rorquals and other large whales , as well as some of the most intelligent , such as elephants , primates , including humans , and cetaceans . the basic body type is a four-legged land-borne animal , but some mammals are adapted for life at sea , in the air , in trees , or on two legs . the largest group of mammals , the placentals , have a placenta , which enables feeding the fetus during gestation . mammals range in size from the 30–40 mm ( 1.2–1.6 in ) bumblebee bat to the 33-meter ( 108 ft ) blue whale .
" race " is still sometimes used within forensic anthropology ( when analyzing skeletal remains ) , biomedical research , and race-based medicine . brace has criticized this , the practice of forensic anthropologists for using the controversial concept " race " out of convention when they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry . he argues that while forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of africa , categorizing that skeletal as being " black " is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular context of the united states , and which is not itself scientifically valid .
rendering software which can not process a unicode character appropriately often displays it as an open rectangle , or the unicode " replacement character " ( u+fffd , � ) , to indicate the position of the unrecognized character . some systems have made attempts to provide more information about such characters . the apple 's last resort font will display a substitute glyph indicating the unicode range of the character , and the sil international 's unicode fallback font will display a box showing the hexadecimal scalar value of the character .
when nike took over from adidas as arsenal 's kit provider in 1994 , arsenal 's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts . since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market , the away kits have been changed regularly , with arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits . during this period the designs have been either all blue designs , or variations on the traditional yellow and blue , such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season , the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007 , and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013 . as of 2009 , the away kit is changed every season , and the outgoing away kit becomes the third-choice kit if a new home kit is being introduced in the same year .
there are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water . there are approximately 5×1030 bacteria on earth , forming a biomass which exceeds that of all plants and animals . bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients , with many of the stages in nutrient cycles dependent on these organisms , such as the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and putrefaction . in the biological communities surrounding hydrothermal vents and cold seeps , bacteria provide the nutrients needed to sustain life by converting dissolved compounds , such as hydrogen sulphide and methane , to energy . on 17 march 2013 , researchers reported data that suggested bacterial life forms thrive in the mariana trench , which with a depth of up to 11 kilometres is the deepest part of the earth 's oceans . other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to 580 metres below the sea floor under 2.6 kilometres of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states . according to one of the researchers , " you can find microbes everywhere — they 're extremely adaptable to conditions , and survive wherever they are . "
with characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty . to clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years , an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the nicene formularies . in the meanwhile , julian , who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that athanasius was exercising at alexandria , addressed an order to ecdicius , the prefect of egypt , peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate , on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency . the edict was communicated to the bishop by pythicodorus trico , who , though described in the " chronicon athanasianum " ( xxxv ) as a " philosopher " , seems to have behaved with brutal insolence . on 23 october the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor 's decree ; but athanasius urged them to submit , consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration .
the estonian dialects are divided into two groups – the northern and southern dialects , historically associated with the cities of tallinn in the north and tartu in the south , in addition to a distinct kirderanniku dialect , that of the northeastern coast of estonia .
mexico ’ s capital is both the oldest capital city in the americas and one of two founded by amerindians ( native americans ) , the other being quito . the city was originally built on an island of lake texcoco by the aztecs in 1325 as tenochtitlan , which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of tenochtitlan , and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the spanish urban standards . in 1524 , the municipality of mexico city was established , known as méxico tenochtitlán , and as of 1585 it was officially known as ciudad de méxico ( mexico city ) . mexico city served as the political , administrative and financial center of a major part of the spanish colonial empire . after independence from spain was achieved , the federal district was created in 1824 .
private cbc affiliates are not as common as they were in the past , as many such stations have been purchased either by the cbc itself or by canwest global or chum limited , respectively becoming e ! or a-channel ( later a , now ctv two ) stations . one private cbc affiliate , chbc-tv in kelowna , joined e ! ( then known as ch ) on february 27 , 2006 . when a private cbc affiliate reaffiliates with another network , the cbc has normally added a retransmitter of its nearest o & o station to ensure that cbc service is continued . however , due to an agreement between chbc and cfjc-tv in kamloops , cfjc also disaffiliated from the cbc on february 27 , 2006 , but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area . former private cbc affiliates ckpg-tv prince george and chat-tv medicine hat disaffiliated on august 31 , 2008 and joined e ! , but the cbc announced it will not add new retransmitters to these areas . incidentally , cfjc , ckpg and chat are all owned by an independent media company , jim pattison group . with the closure of e ! and other changes in the media landscape , several former cbc affiliates have since joined city or global , or closed altogether .
in 1941 , the general anaya borough was merged to the central department , which was then renamed " mexico city " ( thus reviving the name , but not the autonomous municipality ) . from 1941 to 1970 , the federal district comprised twelve delegaciones and mexico city . in 1970 mexico city was split into four different delegaciones : cuauhtémoc , miguel hidalgo , venustiano carranza and benito juárez , increasing the number of delegaciones to sixteen . since then , in a de facto manner , the whole federal district , whose delegaciones had by then almost formed a single urban area , began to be considered a synonym of mexico city .
after the end of the late middle ages period , the renaissance would spread unevenly over continental europe from the southern european region . the intellectual transformation of the renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the middle ages and the modern era . europeans would later begin an era of world discovery . combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning . these two things would lead to the protestant reformation . europeans also discovered new trading routes , as was the case with columbus ’ s travel to the americas in 1492 , and vasco da gama ’ s circumnavigation of africa and india in 1498 . their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of european nations .
newtown creek , a 3.5-mile ( 6-kilometer ) a long estuary that forms part of the border between the boroughs of brooklyn and queens , has been designated a superfund site for environmental clean-up and remediation of the waterway 's recreational and economic resources for many communities . one of the most heavily used bodies of water in the port of new york and new jersey , it had been one of the most contaminated industrial sites in the country , containing years of discarded toxins , an estimated 30 million us gallons ( 110,000 m3 ) of spilled oil , including the greenpoint oil spill , raw sewage from new york city 's sewer system , and other accumulation .
a science hall was built in 1883 under the direction of fr . zahm , but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named lafortune center , after joseph lafortune , an oil executive from tulsa , oklahoma . commonly known as " lafortune " or " lafun , " it is a 4-story building of 83,000 square feet that provides the notre dame community with a meeting place for social , recreational , cultural , and educational activities . lafortune employs 35 part-time student staff and 29 full-time non-student staff and has an annual budget of $ 1.2 million . many businesses , services , and divisions of the office of student affairs are found within . the building also houses restaurants from national restaurant chains .
on the other hand , the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship 's direction of travel , because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other . because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship , the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that ( to the stationary observer ) are many light years apart . this is reconciled by the fact that the crew 's perception of time is different from the stationary observer 's ; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer . in either case , however , causality remains unchanged : the past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals .
until recently , in most critical writing the post-punk era was " often dismissed as an awkward period in which punk 's gleeful ructions petered out into the vacuity of the eighties " . contemporary scholars have argued to the contrary , asserting that the period produced significant innovations and music on its own . simon reynolds described the period as " a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created , the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it , and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era " . nicholas lezard wrote that the music of the period " was avant-garde , open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves , united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral , concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience , or making them think , as in making a pop song " .
today , estonian society encourages liberty and liberalism , with popular commitment to the ideals of the limited government , discouraging centralised power and corruption . the protestant work ethic remains a significant cultural staple , and free education is a highly prized institution . like the mainstream culture in the other nordic countries , estonian culture can be seen to build upon the ascetic environmental realities and traditional livelihoods , a heritage of comparatively widespread egalitarianism out of practical reasons ( see : everyman 's right and universal suffrage ) , and the ideals of closeness to nature and self-sufficiency ( see : summer cottage ) .
although all these different shia tariqahs belong to the shia group ( as opposed to the sunni group ) in islam , there are major doctrinal differences between the main shia tariqahs . after that there is the complete doctrinal break between all the different shia tariqahs whose last imams have gone into occultation and the shia nizari ismailis who deny the very concept of occultation . the shia nizari ismailis by definition have to have a present and living imam until the end of time . [ citation needed ] thus if any living nizari ismaili imam fails to leave behind a successor after him then the nizari ismailism ’ s cardinal principle would be broken and it ’ s very raison d'être would come to an end .
on 15 october 1950 , president truman and general macarthur met at wake island in the mid-pacific ocean . this meeting was much publicized because of the general 's discourteous refusal to meet the president on the continental united states . to president truman , macarthur speculated there was little risk of chinese intervention in korea , and that the prc 's opportunity for aiding the kpa had lapsed . he believed the prc had some 300,000 soldiers in manchuria , and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the yalu river . he further concluded that , although half of those forces might cross south , " if the chinese tried to get down to pyongyang , there would be the greatest slaughter " without air force protection .
during and after the greek war of independence , greeks of the diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state , raising funds and awareness abroad . greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the mediterranean ( notably marseilles in france , livorno in italy , alexandria in egypt ) , russia ( odessa and saint petersburg ) , and britain ( london and liverpool ) from where they traded , typically in textiles and grain . businesses frequently comprised the extended family , and with them they brought schools teaching greek and the greek orthodox church .
paris is the home of the most visited art museum in the world , the louvre , as well as the musée d'orsay , noted for its collection of french impressionist art , and the musée national d'art moderne , a museum of modern and contemporary art . the notable architectural landmarks of paris include notre dame cathedral ( 12th century ) ; the sainte-chapelle ( 13th century ) ; the eiffel tower ( 1889 ) ; and the basilica of sacré-cœur on montmartre ( 1914 ) . in 2014 paris received 22.4 million visitors , making it one of the world 's top tourist destinations . paris is also known for its fashion , particularly the twice-yearly paris fashion week , and for its haute cuisine , and three-star restaurants . most of france 's major universities and grandes écoles are located in paris , as are france 's major newspapers , including le monde , le figaro , and libération .
a countout ( alternatively " count-out " or " count out " ) happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten ( twenty in some promotions ) and thus disqualified . the count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring . playing into this , some wrestlers will " milk " the count by sliding in the ring , and immediately sliding back out . as they were technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again , it is sufficient to restart the count . this is often referred to by commentators as " breaking the count . " heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath , or to attempt to frustrate their babyface opponents .
from an institutional perspective , the rules of the house assign a number of specific responsibilities to the minority leader . for example , rule xii , clause 6 , grant the minority leader ( or his designee ) the right to offer a motion to recommit with instructions ; rule ii , clause 6 , states the inspector general shall be appointed by joint recommendation of the speaker , majority leader , and minority leader ; and rule xv , clause 6 , provides that the speaker , after consultation with the minority leader , may place legislation on the corrections calendar . the minority leader also has other institutional duties , such as appointing individuals to certain federal entities .
pluralistic idealism such as that of gottfried leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe . unlike absolute idealism , pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or " absolute " . leibniz ' form of idealism , known as panpsychism , views " monads " as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception . the monads are " substantial forms of being " , elemental , individual , subject to their own laws , non-interacting , each reflecting the entire universe . monads are centers of force , which is substance while space , matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads . there is a pre-established harmony established by god , the central monad , between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects . leibniz 's cosmology embraced traditional christian theism . the english psychologist and philosopher james ward inspired by leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism . according to ward the universe is composed of " psychic monads " of different levels , interacting for mutual self- betterment .
in mid-november the shevchenko ukrainian language society was officially registered . on november 19 , 1989 , a public gathering in kiev attracted thousands of mourners , friends and family to the reburial in ukraine of three inmates of the infamous gulag camp no . 36 in perm in the ural mountains : human-rights activists vasyl stus , oleksiy tykhy , and yuriy lytvyn . their remains were reinterred in baikove cemetery . on november 26 , 1989 , a day of prayer and fasting was proclaimed by cardinal myroslav lubachivsky , thousands of faithful in western ukraine participated in religious services on the eve of a meeting between pope john paul ii and soviet president gorbachev . on november 28 , 1989 , the ukrainian ssr 's council for religious affairs issued a decree allowing ukrainian catholic congregations to register as legal organizations . the decree was proclaimed on december 1 , coinciding with a meeting at the vatican between the pope and the soviet president .
the hellenistic states of asia and egypt were run by an occupying imperial elite of greco-macedonian administrators and governors propped up by a standing army of mercenaries and a small core of greco-macedonian settlers . promotion of immigration from greece was important in the establishment of this system . hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution . macedonian and hellenistic monarchs were expected to lead their armies on the field , along with a group of privileged aristocratic companions or friends ( hetairoi , philoi ) which dined and drank with the king and acted as his advisory council . another role that was expected the monarch fill was that of charitable patron of his people , this public philanthropy could mean building projects and handing out gifts but also promotion of greek culture and religion .
arsenal 's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs . in 1909 , sparta prague adopted a dark red kit like the one arsenal wore at the time ; in 1938 , hibernian adopted the design of the arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip . in 1920 , sporting clube de braga 's manager returned from a game at highbury and changed his team 's green kit to a duplicate of arsenal 's red with white sleeves and shorts , giving rise to the team 's nickname of os arsenalistas . these teams still wear those designs to this day .

because of the distance of neptune from earth , its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds , the smallest of the solar system planets . its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually . most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of hubble space telescope ( hst ) and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics ( ao ) . the first scientifically useful observation of neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive optics , was commenced in 1997 from hawaii . neptune is currently entering its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up , with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence . combined with technological advancements , ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of this outer planet . both the hst and ao telescopes on earth has made many new discoveries within the solar system since the mid-1990s , with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planets for example . in 2004 and 2005 , five new small satellites of neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered .
for a variety of reasons , market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its impact on the overall stability of the financial system . for example , the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system . banks estimated that $ 450bn of cdo were sold between " late 2005 to the middle of 2007 " ; among the $ 102bn of those that had been liquidated , jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for " high quality " cdos was approximately 32 cents on the dollar , while the recovery rate for mezzanine cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar .

bird migration is primarily , but not entirely , a northern hemisphere phenomenon . this is because land birds in high northern latitudes , where food becomes scarce in winter , leave for areas further south ( including the southern hemisphere ) to overwinter , and because the continental landmass is much larger in the northern hemisphere . in contrast , among ( pelagic ) seabirds , species of the southern hemisphere are more likely to migrate . this is because there is a large area of ocean in the southern hemisphere , and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest .
the bronx is home to several off-off-broadway theaters , many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from latin america and africa . the pregones theater , which produces latin american work , opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on walton avenue in the south bronx . some artists from elsewhere in new york city have begun to converge on the area , and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002 . however rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area .

adolescence ( from latin adolescere , meaning " to grow up " ) is a transitional stage of physical and psychological human development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to legal adulthood ( age of majority ) . the period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years , though its physical , psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later . for example , although puberty has been historically associated with the onset of adolescent development , it now typically begins prior to the teenage years and there has been a normative shift of it occurring in preadolescence , particularly in females ( see precocious puberty ) . physical growth , as distinct from puberty ( particularly in males ) , and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence , can also extend into the early twenties . thus chronological age provides only a rough marker of adolescence , and scholars have found it difficult to agree upon a precise definition of adolescence .
later , during the koine greek period , the aspirated and voiceless stops /tʰ d/ of attic greek lenited to voiceless and voiced fricatives , yielding /θ ð/ in medieval and modern greek .
spielberg first met actress amy irving in 1976 at the suggestion of director brian de palma , who knew he was looking for an actress to play in close encounters . after meeting her , spielberg told his co-producer julia phillips , " i met a real heartbreaker last night . " :293 although she was too young for the role , she and spielberg began dating and she eventually moved in to what she described as his " bachelor funky " house . :294 they lived together for four years , but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship . irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own : " i do n't want to be known as steven 's girlfriend , " she said , and chose not to be in any of his films during those years . :295

the vicereine germaine of foix brutally repressed the uprising and its leaders , and this accelerated the authoritarian centralisation of the government of charles i . queen germaine favoured harsh treatment of the agermanats . she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred . the agermanats are comparable to the comuneros of neighbouring castile , who fought a similar revolt against charles from 1520–1522 .
hunting is claimed to give resource managers an important tool in managing populations that might exceed the carrying capacity of their habitat and threaten the well-being of other species , or , in some instances , damage human health or safety . [ citation needed ] however , in most circumstances carrying capacity is determined by a combination habitat and food availability , and hunting for 'population control ' has no effect on the annual population of species . [ citation needed ] in some cases , it can increase the population of predators such as coyotes by removing territorial bounds that would otherwise be established , resulting in excess neighbouring migrations into an area , thus artificially increasing the population . hunting advocates [ who ? ] assert that hunting reduces intraspecific competition for food and shelter , reducing mortality among the remaining animals . some environmentalists assert [ who ? ] that ( re ) introducing predators would achieve the same end with greater efficiency and less negative effect , such as introducing significant amounts of free lead into the environment and food chain .
in february 2015 , youtube announced the launch of a new app specifically for use by children visiting the site , called youtube kids . it allows parental controls and restrictions on who can upload content , and is available for both android and ios devices . later on august 26 , 2015 , youtube gaming was launched , a platform for video gaming enthusiasts intended to compete with twitch.tv . 2015 also saw the announcement of a premium youtube service titled youtube red , which provides users with both ad-free content as well as the ability to download videos among other features .
since the launch of the " reinvent the toilet challenge " , more than a dozen research teams , mainly at universities in the u.s. , europe , india , china and south africa , have received grants to develop innovative on-site and off-site waste treatment solutions for the urban poor . the grants were in the order of 400,000 usd for their first phase , followed by typically 1-3 million usd for their second phase ; many of them investigated resource recovery or processing technologies for excreta or fecal sludge .
in 1882 , albert zahm ( john zahm 's brother ) built an early wind tunnel used to compare lift to drag of aeronautical models . around 1899 , professor jerome green became the first american to send a wireless message . in 1931 , father julius nieuwland performed early work on basic reactions that was used to create neoprene . study of nuclear physics at the university began with the building of a nuclear accelerator in 1936 , and continues now partly through a partnership in the joint institute for nuclear astrophysics .
since the founding of freemasonry , many bishops of the church of england have been freemasons , such as archbishop geoffrey fisher . in the past , few members of the church of england would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to anglican christianity and practicing freemasonry . in recent decades , however , reservations about freemasonry have increased within anglicanism , perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church . the former archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , appeared to harbour some reservations about masonic ritual , whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to freemasons inside and outside the church of england . in 2003 he felt it necessary to apologise to british freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with christianity and that he had barred the appointment of freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was bishop of monmouth .

no single feature distinguishes annelids from other invertebrate phyla , but they have a distinctive combination of features . their bodies are long , with segments that are divided externally by shallow ring-like constrictions called annuli and internally by septa ( " partitions " ) at the same points , although in some species the septa are incomplete and in a few cases missing . most of the segments contain the same sets of organs , although sharing a common gut , circulatory system and nervous system makes them inter-dependent . their bodies are covered by a cuticle ( outer covering ) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath , is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt – on the other hand arthropods ' cuticles are made of the more rigid α-chitin , and molt until the arthropods reach their full size . most annelids have closed circulatory systems , where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels .
zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away . a protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( zn 5 ( oh ) 6 ( co 3 ) 2 ) forms as the zinc corrodes . this protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away . the zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying . galvanization is used on chain-link fencing , guard rails , suspension bridges , lightposts , metal roofs , heat exchangers , and car bodies .
it was not long until apple released their first portable computer , the macintosh portable in 1989 . although due to considerable design issues , it was soon replaced in 1991 with the first of the powerbook line : the powerbook 100 , a miniaturized portable ; the 16 mhz 68030 powerbook 140 ; and the 25 mhz 68030 powerbook 170 . they were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built-in pointing device ( a trackball ) in front of the keyboard . the 1993 powerbook 165c was apple 's first portable computer to feature a color screen , displaying 256 colors with 640 x 400-pixel resolution . the second generation of powerbooks , the 68040-equipped 500 series , introduced trackpads , integrated stereo speakers , and built-in ethernet to the laptop form factor in 1994 .
fraser maintained some of the social reforms of the whitlam era , while seeking increased fiscal restraint . his government included the first aboriginal federal parliamentarian , neville bonner , and in 1976 , parliament passed the aboriginal land rights act 1976 , which , while limited to the northern territory , affirmed " inalienable " freehold title to some traditional lands . fraser established the multicultural broadcaster sbs , accepted vietnamese refugees , opposed minority white rule in apartheid south africa and rhodesia and opposed soviet expansionism . a significant program of economic reform however was not pursued . by 1983 , the australian economy was suffering with the early 1980s recession and amidst the effects of a severe drought . fraser had promoted " states ' rights " and his government refused to use commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the franklin dam in tasmania in 1982 . liberal minister , don chipp split off from the party to form a new social liberal party , the australian democrats in 1977 . fraser won further substantial majorities at the 1977 and 1980 elections , before losing to the bob hawke led australian labor party in the 1983 election .

the state of tennessee is rooted in the watauga association , a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the appalachians . what is now tennessee was initially part of north carolina , and later part of the southwest territory . tennessee was admitted to the union as the 16th state on june 1 , 1796 . tennessee was the last state to leave the union and join the confederacy at the outbreak of the u.s. civil war in 1861 . occupied by union forces from 1862 , it was the first state to be readmitted to the union at the end of the war .
by total area ( water as well as land ) , the united states is either slightly larger or smaller than the people 's republic of china , making it the world 's third or fourth largest country . china and the united states are smaller than russia and canada in total area , but are larger than brazil . by land area only ( exclusive of waters ) , the united states is the world 's third largest country , after russia and china , with canada in fourth . whether the us or china is the third largest country by total area depends on two factors : ( 1 ) the validity of china 's claim on aksai chin and trans-karakoram tract . both these territories are also claimed by india , so are not counted ; and ( 2 ) how us calculates its own surface area . since the initial publishing of the world factbook , the cia has updated the total area of united states a number of times .
during 1951 , george vi 's health declined and elizabeth frequently stood in for him at public events . when she toured canada and visited president harry s. truman in washington , d.c. , in october 1951 , her private secretary , martin charteris , carried a draft accession declaration in case the king died while she was on tour . in early 1952 , elizabeth and philip set out for a tour of australia and new zealand by way of kenya . on 6 february 1952 , they had just returned to their kenyan home , sagana lodge , after a night spent at treetops hotel , when word arrived of the death of the king and consequently elizabeth 's immediate accession to the throne . philip broke the news to the new queen . martin charteris asked her to choose a regnal name ; she chose to remain elizabeth , " of course " . she was proclaimed queen throughout her realms and the royal party hastily returned to the united kingdom . she and the duke of edinburgh moved into buckingham palace .

by developing commercial centres and routes , encouraging people to extend the area of cultivated land in the country and international trade through its dominions , the state performed basic economic functions in the empire . but in all this the financial and political interests of the state were dominant . within the social and political system they were living in ottoman administrators could not have comprehended or seen the desirability of the dynamics and principles of the capitalist and mercantile economies developing in western europe .
chopin was educated in the tradition of beethoven , haydn , mozart and clementi ; he used clementi 's piano method with his own students . he was also influenced by hummel 's development of virtuoso , yet mozartian , piano technique . he cited bach and mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook . chopin 's early works are in the style of the " brilliant " keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of ignaz moscheles , friedrich kalkbrenner , and others . less direct in the earlier period are the influences of polish folk music and of italian opera . much of what became his typical style of ornamentation ( for example , his fioriture ) is taken from singing . his melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country , such as drones .
according to the sunni scholar ibn ʻasākir in the 12th century , there were opportunities for female education in the medieval islamic world , writing that women could study , earn ijazahs ( academic degrees ) , and qualify as scholars and teachers . this was especially the case for learned and scholarly families , who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters . ibn ʻasakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time . female education in the islamic world was inspired by muhammad 's wives , such as khadijah , a successful businesswoman . according to a hadith attributed to muhammad , he praised the women of medina because of their desire for religious knowledge :

federalism , and other forms of territorially autonomy , is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order prevent violence among different groups with countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level . some scholars have suggested , however , that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states . still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms tthat encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries .
in a peabody award winning program , npr correspondents argued that a " giant pool of money " ( represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments ) sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade . this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 , yet the supply of relatively safe , income generating investments had not grown as fast . investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies .
the climatic changes of the late jurassic and cretaceous provided for further adaptive radiation . the jurassic was the height of archosaur diversity , and the first birds and eutherian mammals also appeared . angiosperms radiated sometime in the early cretaceous , first in the tropics , but the even temperature gradient allowed them to spread toward the poles throughout the period . by the end of the cretaceous , angiosperms dominated tree floras in many areas , although some evidence suggests that biomass was still dominated by cycad and ferns until after the cretaceous–paleogene extinction .
some możni ( magnates ) descending from past tribal dynasties regarded themselves as co-proprietors of piast realms , even though the piasts attempted to deprive them of their independence . these możni ( magnates ) constantly sought to undermine princely authority . :75 , 76 in gall anonym 's chronicle , there is noted the nobility 's alarm when the palatine sieciech " elevated those of a lower class over those who were noble born " entrusting them with state offices . ( manteuffel 1982 , p. 149 )
robert n. bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the united states , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the united states . he used the term " civil religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the united states . his 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of john f. kennedy : " considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'god ' at all ? the answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "
in the early 20th century , carl von voit and max rubner independently measured caloric energy expenditure in different species of animals , applying principles of physics in nutrition . in 1906 , edith g. willcock and frederick hopkins showed that the amino acid tryptophan aids the well-being of mice but it did not assure their growth . in the middle of twelve years of attempts to isolate them , hopkins said in a 1906 lecture that " unsuspected dietetic factors , " other than calories , protein , and minerals , are needed to prevent deficiency diseases . in 1907 , stephen m. babcock and edwin b. hart conducted the single-grain experiment , which took nearly four years to complete .
the gender of god may be viewed as either a literal or an allegorical aspect of a deity who , in classical western philosophy , transcends bodily form . polytheistic religions commonly attribute to each of the gods a gender , allowing each to interact with any of the others , and perhaps with humans , sexually . in most monotheistic religions , god has no counterpart with which to relate sexually . thus , in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and god address , and relate to , each other . namely , god is seen as begetter of the world and revelation which corresponds to the active ( as opposed to the receptive ) role in sexual intercourse .
the new haven green is the site of many free music concerts , especially during the summer months . these have included the new haven symphony orchestra , the july free concerts on the green in july , and the new haven jazz festival in august . the jazz festival , which began in 1982 , is one of the longest-running free outdoor festivals in the u.s. , until it was canceled for 2007 . headliners such as the breakfast , dave brubeck , ray charles and celia cruz have historically drawn 30,000 to 50,000 fans , filling up the new haven green to capacity . the new haven jazz festival was revived in 2008 and has been sponsored since by jazz haven .
the state united behind the plan of ayutla and ratified the new constitution in 1855 . the state was able to survive through the reform war with minimal damage due to the large number of liberal political figures . the 1858 conservative movement did not succeed in the state even after the successful military campaign of the conservative zuloaga with 1,000 men occupied the cities of chihuahua and parral . in august 1859 , zuloaga and his forces were defeated by the liberal orozco and his forces ; orozco soon after deposed the state governor , but had to flee to durango two months later . in the late 1860s the conservative general cajen briefly entered the state after his campaign through the state of jalisco and helped establish conservative politicians and ran out the liberal leaders jesús gonzález ortega and josé maría patoni . cajen took possession of the state capital and established himself as governor ; he brooked no delay in uniting a large force to combat the liberal forces which he defeated in la batalla del gallo . cajen attained several advantages over the liberals within the state , but soon lost his standing due to a strong resurgence of the liberal forces within the state . the successful liberal leaders josé maría patoni of durango and j.e . muñoz of chihuahua quickly strengthened their standing by limiting the political rights of the clergy implementing the presidential decree . the state elected general luis terrazas , a liberal leader , as governor ; he would continue to fight small battles within the state to suppress conservative uprisings during 1861 .
on the basis of the expansion and development of yerevan state university a number of higher educational independent institutions were formed including medical institute separated in 1930 which was set up on the basis of medical faculty . in 1980 yerevan state medical university was awarded one of the main rewards of the former ussr – the order of labor red banner for training qualified specialists in health care and valuable service in the development of medical science . in 1995 ysmi was renamed to ysmu and since 1989 it has been named after mkhitar heratsi , the famous medieval doctor . mkhitar heratsi was the founder of armenian medical school in cilician armenia . the great doctor played the same role in armenian medical science as hippocrates in western , galen in roman , ibn sīnā in arabic medicine .
the convention came into force as international law on 12 january 1951 after the minimum 20 countries became parties . at that time however , only two of the five permanent members of the un security council were parties to the treaty : france and the republic of china . the soviet union ratified in 1954 , the united kingdom in 1970 , the people 's republic of china in 1983 ( having replaced the taiwan-based republic of china on the unsc in 1971 ) , and the united states in 1988 . this long delay in support for the convention by the world 's most powerful nations caused the convention to languish for over four decades . only in the 1990s did the international law on the crime of genocide begin to be enforced .
antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use , and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated . however , some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects . side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the microbial organisms targeted , and the individual patient . side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis . safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use . adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis . common side-effects include diarrhea , resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora , resulting , for example , in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria , such as clostridium difficile . antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora , and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus candida in the vulvo-vaginal area . additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid . some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease .
the city is represented in the national football league by the new york giants and the new york jets , although both teams play their home games at metlife stadium in nearby east rutherford , new jersey , which hosted super bowl xlviii in 2014 .
however many early history books like the islamic conquest of syria fatuhusham by al-imam al-waqidi state that after the conversion to islam muawiyah 's father abu sufyan ibn harb and his brothers yazid ibn abi sufyan were appointed as commanders in the muslim armies by muhammad . muawiyah , abu sufyan ibn harb , yazid ibn abi sufyan and hind bint utbah fought in the battle of yarmouk . the defeat of the byzantine emperor heraclius at the battle of yarmouk opened the way for the muslim expansion into jerusalem and syria .
on 1 february 1908 , the king dom carlos i of portugal and his heir apparent , prince royal dom luís filipe , duke of braganza , were murdered in lisbon . under his rule , portugal had twice been declared bankrupt – on 14 june 1892 , and again on 10 may 1902 – causing social turmoil , economic disturbances , protests , revolts and criticism of the monarchy . manuel ii of portugal became the new king , but was eventually overthrown by the 5 october 1910 revolution , which abolished the regime and instated republicanism in portugal . political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the portuguese first republic . these conditions would lead to the failed monarchy of the north , 28 may 1926 coup d'état , and the creation of the national dictatorship ( ditadura nacional ) .
cycling is popular in tucson due to its flat terrain and dry climate . tucson and pima county maintain an extensive network of marked bike routes , signal crossings , on-street bike lanes , mountain-biking trails , and dedicated shared-use paths . the loop is a network of seven linear parks comprising over 100 mi ( 160 km ) of paved , vehicle-free trails that encircles the majority of the city with links to marana and oro valley . the tucson-pima county bicycle advisory committee ( tpcbac ) serves in an advisory capacity to local governments on issues relating to bicycle recreation , transportation , and safety . tucson was awarded a gold rating for bicycle-friendliness by the league of american bicyclists in 2006 .

beyoncé has stated that she is personally inspired by us first lady michelle obama , saying " she proves you can do it all " and she has described oprah winfrey as " the definition of inspiration and a strong woman " . she has also discussed how jay z is a continuing inspiration to her , both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life . beyoncé has expressed admiration for the artist jean-michel basquiat , posting in a letter " what i find in the work of jean-michel basquiat , i search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw " . in february 2013 , beyoncé said that madonna inspired her to take control of her own career . she commented : " i think about madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists . but there are not enough of those women . " .
reform of the liturgy had been a part of the liturgical movements in the 20th century mainly in france , and germany which were officially recognized by pius xii in his encyclical mediator dei . during the pontificate of pius xii , the vatican eased regulations on the use of latin in roman catholic liturgies , permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms , funerals and other events . in 1951 and 1955 , the easter liturgies underwent revision , most notably including the reintroduction of the easter triduum . the second vatican council made no changes to the roman missal , but in the document sacrosanctum concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place . after the vatican council , in april 1969 , paul vi approved the " new order of mass " promulgated in 1970 , as stated in the acta apostolica sedis to " end experimentation " with the mass and which included the introduction of three new eucharistic prayers to what was up to then a single roman canon .
new delhi is home to several historic sites and museums . the national museum which began with an exhibition of indian art and artefacts at the royal academy in london in the winter of 1947–48 was later at the end was shown at the rashtrapati bhawan in 1949 . later it was to form a permanent national museum . on 15 august 1949 , the national museum was formally inaugurated and currently has 200,000 works of art , both of indian and foreign origin , covering over 5,000 years .
speaker martin concluded that eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with congress , with results , " often the reverse of what he has desired " because members of congress , " resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the white house without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'the chief wants this ' . the administration never made use of many republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking . "
hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . in cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the fish and wildlife service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
jessica sanchez received the fewest number of votes during the top 7 week , and the judges decided to use their " save " option on her , making her the first female recipient of the save . the following week , unlike previous seasons , colton dixon was the only contestant sent home . sanchez later made the final two , the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale .
the same divine agencies who caused disease or harm also had the power to avert it , and so might be placated in advance . divine consideration might be sought to avoid the inconvenient delays of a journey , or encounters with banditry , piracy and shipwreck , with due gratitude to be rendered on safe arrival or return . in times of great crisis , the senate could decree collective public rites , in which rome 's citizens , including women and children , moved in procession from one temple to the next , supplicating the gods .
the term also has closely related synonyms that are employed throughout the quran . each synonym possesses its own distinct meaning , but its use may converge with that of qurʼān in certain contexts . such terms include kitāb ( book ) ; āyah ( sign ) ; and sūrah ( scripture ) . the latter two terms also denote units of revelation . in the large majority of contexts , usually with a definite article ( al- ) , the word is referred to as the " revelation " ( waḥy ) , that which has been " sent down " ( tanzīl ) at intervals . other related words are : dhikr ( remembrance ) , used to refer to the quran in the sense of a reminder and warning , and ḥikmah ( wisdom ) , sometimes referring to the revelation or part of it .
the d-day normandy landings on june 6 , 1944 , were costly but successful . a month later , the invasion of southern france took place , and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the afhq to the shaef . many prematurely considered that victory in europe would come by summer 's end—however the germans did not capitulate for almost a year . from then until the end of the war in europe on may 8 , 1945 , eisenhower , through shaef , commanded all allied forces , and through his command of etousa had administrative command of all u.s. forces on the western front north of the alps . he was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families . this prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion . eisenhower 's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed . it has been called one of the great speeches of history :
when endothermy first appeared in the evolution of mammals is uncertain . modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals , but there is evidence that some of their ancestors , perhaps including ancestors of the therians , may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians . some of the evidence found so far suggests that triassic cynodonts had fairly high metabolic rates , but it is not conclusive . for small animals , an insulative covering like fur is necessary for the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature .
armenia established a church that still exists independently of both the catholic and the eastern orthodox churches , having become so in 451 ad as a result of its stance regarding the council of chalcedon . today this church is known as the armenian apostolic church , which is a part of the oriental orthodox communion , not to be confused with the eastern orthodox communion . during its later political eclipses , armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity . the original location of the armenian catholicosate is echmiadzin . however , the continuous upheavals , which characterized the political scenes of armenia , made the political power move to safer places . the church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority . therefore , it eventually moved to cilicia as the holy see of cilicia .
though the music varied widely between regions and artists , the post-punk movement has been characterized by its " conceptual assault " on rock conventions and rejection of aesthetics perceived of as traditionalist , hegemonic or rockist in favor of experimentation with production techniques and non-rock musical styles such as dub , electronic music , disco , noise , jazz , krautrock , world music and the avant-garde . while post-punk musicians often avoided or intentionally obscured conventional influences , previous musical styles did serve as touchstones for the movement , including particular brands of glam , art rock and " [ the ] dark undercurrent of '60s music " . [ nb 1 ] according to reynolds , artists once again approached the studio as an instrument , using new recording methods and pursuing novel sonic territories . author matthew bannister wrote that post-punk artists rejected the high cultural references of 1960s rock artists like the beatles and bob dylan as well as paradigms that defined " rock as progressive , as art , as 'sterile ' studio perfectionism ... by adopting an avant-garde aesthetic " .
in spring 1855 , the allied british-french commanders decided to send an anglo-french naval squadron into the azov sea to undermine russian communications and supplies to besieged sevastopol . on 12 may 1855 , british-french warships entered the kerch strait and destroyed the coast battery of the kamishevaya bay . on 21 may 1855 , the gunboats and armed steamers attacked the seaport of taganrog , the most important hub near rostov on don . the vast amounts of food , especially bread , wheat , barley , and rye that were amassed in the city after the outbreak of war were prevented from being exported .
apple did not develop the ipod software entirely in-house , instead using portalplayer 's reference platform based on two arm cores . the platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system . portalplayer had previously been working on an ibm-branded mp3 player with bluetooth headphones . apple contracted another company , pixo , to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of steve jobs . as development progressed , apple continued to refine the software 's look and feel . starting with the ipod mini , the chicago font was replaced with espy sans . later ipods switched fonts again to podium sans—a font similar to apple 's corporate font , myriad . ipods with color displays then adopted some mac os x themes like aqua progress bars , and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock . in 2007 , apple modified the ipod interface again with the introduction of the sixth-generation ipod classic and third-generation ipod nano by changing the font to helvetica and , in most cases , splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork , photos , or videos on the right ( whichever was appropriate for the selected item ) .
in april 1979 , young students protested against bokassa 's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives . the government violently suppressed the protests , killing 100 children and teenagers . bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings . in september 1979 , france overthrew bokassa and " restored " dacko to power ( subsequently restoring the name of the country to the central african republic ) . dacko , in turn , was again overthrown in a coup by general andré kolingba on 1 september 1981 .
from the rigveda until the time of pāṇini ( fourth century bce ) the development of the early vedic language can be observed in other vedic texts : the samaveda , yajurveda , atharvaveda , brahmanas , and upanishads . during this time , the prestige of the language , its use for sacred purposes , and the importance attached to its correct enunciation all served as powerful conservative forces resisting the normal processes of linguistic change . however , there is a clear , five-level linguistic development of vedic from the rigveda to the language of the upanishads and the earliest sutras such as the baudhayana sutras .
law offers more ambiguity . some writings of plato and aristotle , the law tables of hammurabi of babylon , or even the early parts of the bible could be seen as legal literature . roman civil law as codified in the corpus juris civilis during the reign of justinian i of the byzantine empire has a reputation as significant literature . the founding documents of many countries , including constitutions and law codes , can count as literature ; however , most legal writings rarely exhibit much literary merit , as they tend to be rather written by samuel dean .
in 1219 pope honorius iii invited saint dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient roman basilica of santa sabina , which they did by early 1220 . before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in rome at the convent of san sisto vecchio which honorius iii had given to dominic circa 1218 intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at rome under dominic 's guidance . in may 1220 at bologna the order 's first general chapter mandated that each new priory of the order maintain its own studium conventuale thus laying the foundation of the dominican tradition of sponsoring widespread institutions of learning . the official foundation of the dominican convent at santa sabina with its studium conventuale occurred with the legal transfer of property from honorius iii to the order of preachers on june 5 , 1222 . this studium was transformed into the order 's first studium provinciale by saint thomas aquinas in 1265 . part of the curriculum of this studium was relocated in 1288 at the studium of santa maria sopra minerva which in the 16th century world be transformed into the college of saint thomas ( latin : collegium divi thomæ ) . in the 20th century the college would be relocated to the convent of saints dominic and sixtus and would be transformed into the pontifical university of saint thomas aquinas , angelicum .
the proper recitation of the quran is the subject of a separate discipline named tajwid which determines in detail how the quran should be recited , how each individual syllable is to be pronounced , the need to pay attention to the places where there should be a pause , to elisions , where the pronunciation should be long or short , where letters should be sounded together and where they should be kept separate , etc . it may be said that this discipline studies the laws and methods of the proper recitation of the quran and covers three main areas : the proper pronunciation of consonants and vowels ( the articulation of the quranic phonemes ) , the rules of pause in recitation and of resumption of recitation , and the musical and melodious features of recitation .
between 1847 and 1850 , when blore was building the new east wing , the brighton pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings . as a result , many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere . the red and blue chinese luncheon room is made up from parts of the brighton banqueting and music rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by richard westmacott . the yellow drawing room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the brighton saloon , and a chimney piece which is a european vision of how the chinese chimney piece may appear . it has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons , designed by robert jones .
in the wake of the republic 's collapse , state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors . augustus , the first roman emperor , justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast program of religious revivalism and reform . public vows formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor . so-called " emperor worship " expanded on a grand scale the traditional roman veneration of the ancestral dead and of the genius , the divine tutelary of every individual . imperial cult became one of the major ways in which rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the empire . rejection of the state religion was tantamount to treason . this was the context for rome 's conflict with christianity , which romans variously regarded as a form of atheism and novel superstitio .
st. john 's is one of the oldest settlements in north america , with year-round settlement beginning sometime after 1630 and seasonal habitation long before that . it is not , however , the oldest surviving english settlement in north america or canada , having been preceded by the cuper 's cove colony at cupids , founded in 1610 , and the bristol 's hope colony at harbour grace , founded in 1618 . in fact , although english fishermen had begun setting up seasonal camps in newfoundland in the 16th century , they were expressly forbidden by the british government , at the urging of the west country fishing industry , from establishing permanent settlements along the english controlled coast , hence the town of st. john 's was not established as a permanent community until after the 1630s at the earliest . other permanent english settlements in the americas that predate st. john 's include : st. george 's , bermuda ( 1612 ) and jamestown , virginia ( 1607 ) .
the median household income in boston was $ 51,739 , while the median income for a family was $ 61,035 . full-time year-round male workers had a median income of $ 52,544 versus $ 46,540 for full-time year-round female workers . the per capita income for the city was $ 33,158 . 21.4 % of the population and 16.0 % of families are below the poverty line . of the total population , 28.8 % of those under the age of 18 and 20.4 % of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line .
the city receives 49.9 inches ( 1,270 mm ) of precipitation annually , which is fairly spread throughout the year . average winter snowfall between 1981 and 2010 has been 25.8 inches ( 66 cm ) , but this varies considerably from year to year . hurricanes and tropical storms are rare in the new york area , but are not unheard of and always have the potential to strike the area . hurricane sandy brought a destructive storm surge to new york city on the evening of october 29 , 2012 , flooding numerous streets , tunnels , and subway lines in lower manhattan and other areas of the city and cutting off electricity in many parts of the city and its suburbs . the storm and its profound impacts have prompted the discussion of constructing seawalls and other coastal barriers around the shorelines of the city and the metropolitan area to minimize the risk of destructive consequences from another such event in the future .
passenger elevators capacity is related to the available floor space . generally passenger elevators are available in capacities from 500 to 2,700 kg ( 1,000–6,000 lb ) in 230 kg ( 500 lb ) increments . [ citation needed ] generally passenger elevators in buildings of eight floors or fewer are hydraulic or electric , which can reach speeds up to 1 m/s ( 200 ft/min ) hydraulic and up to 152 m/min ( 500 ft/min ) electric . in buildings up to ten floors , electric and gearless elevators are likely to have speeds up to 3 m/s ( 500 ft/min ) , and above ten floors speeds range 3 to 10 m/s ( 500–2,000 ft/min ) .

by 16:50 , with the prussian southern attacks in danger of breaking up , the prussian 3rd guards infantry brigade of the second army opened an attack against the french positions at st. privat which were commanded by general canrobert . at 17:15 , the prussian 4th guards infantry brigade joined the advance followed at 17:45 by the prussian 1st guards infantry brigade . all of the prussian guard attacks were pinned down by lethal french gunfire from the rifle pits and trenches . at 18:15 the prussian 2nd guards infantry brigade , the last of the 1st guards infantry division , was committed to the attack on st. privat while steinmetz committed the last of the reserves of the first army across the mance ravine . by 18:30 , a considerable portion of the vii and viii corps disengaged from the fighting and withdrew towards the prussian positions at rezonville .
pal , secam and ntsc frame rates technically apply only to analogue standard definition television , not to digital or high definition broadcasts . however , with the roll out of digital broadcasting , and later hdtv broadcasting , countries retained their heritage systems . hdtv in former pal and secam countries operates at a frame rate of 25/50 hz , while hdtv in former ntsc countries operates at 30/60 hz .
the city has a rich history , spanning nearly 2000 years , as inferred from inscriptions found in the valley . religious and cultural festivities form a major part of the lives of people residing in kathmandu . most of kathmandu 's people follow hinduism and many others follow buddhism . there are people of other religious beliefs as well , giving kathmandu a cosmopolitan culture . nepali is the most commonly spoken language in the city . english is understood by kathmandu 's educated residents . historic areas of kathmandu were devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake on 25 april 2015 .
by the end of the western roman empire , the town was known simply as parisius in latin and paris in french . christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century ad . according to tradition , it was brought by saint denis , the first bishop of paris . when he refused to renounce his faith , he was beheaded on the hill which became known as the " mountain of martyrs " ( mons martyrum ) , eventually " montmartre " . his burial place became an important religious shrine ; the basilica of saint-denis was built there and became the burial place of the french kings .
the law of criminal procedure in the united states consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials . due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the u.s. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts , the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights . in turn , the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers , of which the most famous is the miranda warning . the writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention , while the civil rights act of 1871 and bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality .
according to the writer of luke , mary was a relative of elizabeth , wife of the priest zechariah of the priestly division of abijah , who was herself part of the lineage of aaron and so of the tribe of levi . [ luke 1:5 ; 1:36 ] some of those who consider that the relationship with elizabeth was on the maternal side , consider that mary , like joseph , to whom she was betrothed , was of the house of david and so of the tribe of judah , and that the genealogy of jesus presented in luke 3 from nathan , third son of david and bathsheba , is in fact the genealogy of mary , [ need quotation to verify ] while the genealogy from solomon given in matthew 1 is that of joseph . ( aaron 's wife elisheba was of the tribe of judah , so all their descendants are from both levi and judah . ) [ num.1:7 & ex.6:23 ]
the largest and bloodiest american battle came at okinawa , as the u.s. sought airbases for 3,000 b-29 bombers and 240 squadrons of b-17 bombers for the intense bombardment of japan 's home islands in preparation for a full-scale invasion in late 1945 . the japanese , with 115,000 troops augmented by thousands of civilians on the heavily populated island , did not resist on the beaches—their strategy was to maximize the number of soldier and marine casualties , and naval losses from kamikaze attacks . after an intense bombardment the americans landed on 1 april 1945 and declared victory on 21 june . the supporting naval forces were the targets for 4,000 sorties , many by kamikaze suicide planes . u.s. losses totaled 38 ships of all types sunk and 368 damaged with 4,900 sailors killed . the americans suffered 75,000 casualties on the ground ; 94 % of the japanese soldiers died along with many civilians .
on february 14 , 2009 , the walt disney company debuted " the american idol experience " at its disney 's hollywood studios theme park at the walt disney world resort in florida . in this live production , co-produced by 19 entertainment , park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for disney cast members . those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the idol set . three judges , whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real idol judges , critiqued the performances . audience members then voted for their favorite performer . there were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a " finals " show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner . the winner of the finals show received a " dream ticket " that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future american idol audition . the attraction closed on august 30 , 2014 .
dowding was summoned to an air ministry conference on 17 october 1940 to explain the poor state of night defences and the supposed ( but ultimately successful ) " failure " of his daytime strategy . the criticism of his leadership extended far beyond the air council , and the minister of aircraft production , lord beaverbrook , and churchill themselves intimated their support was waning . while the failure of night defence preparation was undeniable , it was not the aoc 's responsibility to accrue resources . the general neglect of the raf until the late spurt in 1938 had left sparse resources to build defences . while it was permissible to disagree with dowding 's operational and tactical deployment of forces , the failure of the government and air ministry to allot resources was ultimately the responsibility of the civil and military institutions at large . in the pre-war period , the chamberlain government stated that night defence from air attack should not take up much of the national effort and , along with the air ministry , did not make it a priority .
us troops participated in a un peacekeeping mission in somalia beginning in 1992 . by 1993 the us troops were augmented with rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord mohamed farrah aidid , whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from pakistan . during a raid in downtown mogadishu , us troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the battle of mogadishu . eighteen american soldiers were killed , and a us television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob . somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated 1,000–5,000 total casualties during the conflict . after much public disapproval , american forces were quickly withdrawn by president bill clinton . the incident profoundly affected us thinking about peacekeeping and intervention . the book black hawk down was written about the battle , and was the basis for the later movie of the same name .
because of the general instability of the federal government during 1828 , the installation of the new legislature did not take place until the middle of the following year . it was quickly dissolved by governor santiago de baca ortiz , who replaced it with a more pronounced yorkino type . when guerrero 's liberal administration was overthrown in december , gaspar de ochoa aligned with anastasio bustamante , and in february 1830 , organized an opposition group that arrested the new governor , f. elorriaga , along with other prominent yorkinos . he then summoned the legislature , which had been dissolved by baca . the civil and military authorities were now headed by j . a. pescador and simón ochoa .
laserdiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes . because the discs were read optically instead of magnetically , no physical contact needs to be made between the player and the disc , except for the player 's clamp that holds the disc at its center as it is spun and read . as a result , playback would not wear the information-bearing part of the discs , and properly manufactured lds would theoretically last beyond one 's lifetime . by contrast , a vhs tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum , causing progressive wear with each use ( though later in vhs 's lifespan , engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact ) . also , the tape was thin and delicate , and it was easy for a player mechanism , especially on a low quality or malfunctioning model , to mishandle the tape and damage it by creasing it , frilling ( stretching ) its edges , or even breaking it .
from 9 february for two days his coffin rested in st. mary magdalene church , sandringham , before lying in state at westminster hall from 11 february . his funeral took place at st. george 's chapel , windsor castle , on the 15th . he was interred initially in the royal vault until he was transferred to the king george vi memorial chapel inside st. george 's on 26 march 1969 . in 2002 , fifty years after his death , the remains of his widow , queen elizabeth the queen mother , and the ashes of his younger daughter princess margaret , who both died that year , were interred in the chapel alongside him .
this is fortunate , since antennas at lower frequencies which are not rather large ( a good fraction of a wavelength in size ) are inevitably inefficient ( due to the small radiation resistance rr of small antennas ) . most am broadcast radios ( except for car radios ) take advantage of this principle by including a small loop antenna for reception which has an extremely poor efficiency . using such an inefficient antenna at this low frequency ( 530–1650 khz ) thus has little effect on the receiver 's net performance , but simply requires greater amplification by the receiver 's electronics . contrast this tiny component to the massive and very tall towers used at am broadcast stations for transmitting at the very same frequency , where every percentage point of reduced antenna efficiency entails a substantial cost .
by 1874 , bell 's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage , with progress made both at his new boston " laboratory " ( a rented facility ) and at his family home in canada a big success . [ n 14 ] while working that summer in brantford , bell experimented with a " phonautograph " , a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations . bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves . bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound . but he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas .
the terms 'federalism ' and 'confederalism ' both have a root in the latin word foedus , meaning treaty , pact or covenant . their common meaning until the late eighteenth century was a simple league or inter-governmental relationship among sovereign states based upon a treaty . they were therefore initially synonyms . it was in this sense that james madison in federalist 39 had referred to the new united states as 'neither a national nor a federal constitution , but a composition of both ' ( ie . neither a single large unitary state nor a league/confederation among several small states , but a hybrid of the two ) . in the course of the nineteenth century the meaning of federalism would come to shift , strengthening to refer uniquely to the novel compound political form , while the meaning of confederalism would remain at a league of states . thus , this article relates to the modern usage of the word 'federalism ' .
one such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture , which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture , both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design . while it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism , others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture .
hyderabad was historically known as a pearl and diamond trading centre , and it continues to be known as the city of pearls . many of the city 's traditional bazaars , including laad bazaar , begum bazaar and sultan bazaar , have remained open for centuries . however , industrialisation throughout the 20th century attracted major indian manufacturing , research and financial institutions , including bharat heavy electricals limited , the national geophysical research institute and the centre for cellular and molecular biology . special economic zones dedicated to information technology have encouraged companies from across india and around the world to set up operations and the emergence of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the 1990s led to the area 's naming as india 's " genome valley " . with an output of us $ 74 billion , hyderabad is the fifth-largest contributor to india 's overall gross domestic product .
between 1993 and 1996 , the fbi increased its counter-terrorism role in the wake of the first 1993 world trade center bombing in new york city , new york ; the 1995 oklahoma city bombing in oklahoma city , oklahoma ; and the arrest of the unabomber in 1996 . technological innovation and the skills of fbi laboratory analysts helped ensure that the three cases were successfully prosecuted . justice department investigations into the fbi 's roles in the ruby ridge and waco incidents were found to be obstructed by agents within the bureau . during the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta , georgia , the fbi was criticized for its investigation of the centennial olympic park bombing . it has settled a dispute with richard jewell , who was a private security guard at the venue , along with some media organizations , in regard to the leaking of his name during the investigation .
the crimean war marked the ascendancy of france to the position of pre-eminent power on the continent , :411 the continued decline of the ottoman empire , and the beginning of a decline for tsarist russia . as fuller notes , " russia had been beaten on the crimean peninsula , and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness . " the crimean war marks the demise of the concert of europe , the balance of power that had dominated europe since the congress of vienna in 1815 , and which had included france , russia , austria and the united kingdom .
the layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern , cut through by wide radial boulevards , and string of gardens surrounding the central city was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s . these areas were rapidly filled from the mid 1850s by the ubiquitous terrace house , as well as detached houses and some grand mansions in large grounds , while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets . melbourne quickly became a major finance centre , home to several banks , the royal mint , and australia 's first stock exchange in 1861 . in 1855 the melbourne cricket club secured possession of its now famous ground , the mcg . members of the melbourne football club codified australian football in 1859 , and yarra rowing clubs and " regattas " became popular about the same time . in 1861 the melbourne cup was first run . in 1864 melbourne acquired its first public monument—the burke and wills statue .
with japanese and allied forces occupying various parts of the island , over the following six months both sides poured resources into an escalating battle of attrition on land , at sea , and in the sky . most of the japanese aircraft based in the south pacific were redeployed to the defense of guadalcanal . many were lost in numerous engagements with the allied air forces based at henderson field as well as carrier based aircraft . meanwhile , japanese ground forces launched repeated attacks on heavily defended us positions around henderson field , in which they suffered appalling casualties . to sustain these offensives , resupply was carried out by japanese convoys , termed the " tokyo express " by the allies . the convoys often faced night battles with enemy naval forces in which they expended destroyers that the ijn could ill-afford to lose . later fleet battles involving heavier ships and even daytime carrier battles resulted in a stretch of water near guadalcanal becoming known as " ironbottom sound " from the multitude of ships sunk on both sides . however , the allies were much better able to replace these losses . finally recognizing that the campaign to recapture henderson field and secure guadalcanal had simply become too costly to continue , the japanese evacuated the island and withdrew in february 1943 . in the sixth month war of attrition , the japanese had lost as a result of failing to commit enough forces in sufficient time .
notre dame is known for its competitive admissions , with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2015 admitting 3,577 from a pool of 18,156 ( 19.7 % ) . the academic profile of the enrolled class continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research universities . the university practices a non-restrictive early action policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to notre dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted . 1,400 of the 3,577 ( 39.1 % ) were admitted under the early action plan . admitted students came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750 miles to notre dame , making it arguably the most representative university in the united states . while all entering students begin in the college of the first year of studies , 25 % have indicated they plan to study in the liberal arts or social sciences , 24 % in engineering , 24 % in business , 24 % in science , and 3 % in architecture .
most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0 % copper . examples include chuquicamata in chile , bingham canyon mine in utah , united states and el chino mine in new mexico , united states . according to the british geological survey , in 2005 , chile was the top mine producer of copper with at least one-third world share followed by the united states , indonesia and peru . copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process . several sites in the state of arizona are considered prime candidates for this method . the amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage .
german historian reinhart koselleck claimed that " on the continent there were two social structures that left a decisive imprint on the age of enlightenment : the republic of letters and the masonic lodges . " scottish professor thomas munck argues that " although the masons did promote international and cross-social contacts which were essentially non-religious and broadly in agreement with enlightened values , they can hardly be described as a major radical or reformist network in their own right . " many of the masons values seemed to greatly appeal to enlightenment values and thinkers . diderot discusses the link between freemason ideals and the enlightenment in d'alembert 's dream , exploring masonry as a way of spreading enlightenment beliefs . historian margaret jacob stresses the importance of the masons in indirectly inspiring enlightened political thought . on the negative side , daniel roche contests claims that masonry promoted egalitarianism . he argues that the lodges only attracted men of similar social backgrounds . the presence of noble women in the french " lodges of adoption " that formed in the 1780s was largely due to the close ties shared between these lodges and aristocratic society .
notre dame alumni work in various fields . alumni working in political fields include state governors , members of the united states congress , and former united states secretary of state condoleezza rice . a notable alumnus of the college of science is medicine nobel prize winner eric f. wieschaus . a number of university heads are alumni , including notre dame 's current president , the rev . john jenkins . additionally , many alumni are in the media , including talk show hosts regis philbin and phil donahue , and television and radio personalities such as mike golic and hannah storm . with the university having high profile sports teams itself , a number of alumni went on to become involved in athletics outside the university , including professional baseball , basketball , football , and ice hockey players , such as joe theismann , joe montana , tim brown , ross browner , rocket ismail , ruth riley , jeff samardzija , jerome bettis , brett lebda , olympic gold medalist mariel zagunis , professional boxer mike lee , former football coaches such as charlie weis , frank leahy and knute rockne , and basketball hall of famers austin carr and adrian dantley . other notable alumni include prominent businessman edward j. debartolo , jr. and astronaut jim wetherbee .
translation has served as a school of writing for many authors . translators , including monks who spread buddhist texts in east asia , and the early modern european translators of the bible , in the course of their work have shaped the very languages into which they have translated . they have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between cultures ; and along with ideas , they have imported from the source languages , into their own languages , loanwords and calques of grammatical structures , idioms and vocabulary .
the struggle related to the constitutional movement continued until 1911 , when mohammad ali shah was defeated and forced to abdicate . on the pretext of restoring order , the russians occupied northern iran in 1911 , and maintained a military presence in the region for years to come . during world war i , the british occupied much of western iran , and fully withdrew in 1921 . the persian campaign commenced furthermore during world war i in northwestern iran after an ottoman invasion , as part of the middle eastern theatre of world war i . as a result of ottoman hostilities across the border , a large amount of the assyrians of iran were massacred by the ottoman armies , notably in and around urmia . apart from the rule of aqa mohammad khan , the qajar rule is characterized as a century of misrule .
the xeer legal system also requires a certain amount of specialization of different functions within the legal framework . thus , one can find odayal ( judges ) , xeer boggeyaal ( jurists ) , guurtiyaal ( detectives ) , garxajiyaal ( attorneys ) , murkhaatiyal ( witnesses ) and waranle ( police officers ) to enforce the law .
the portuguese language is the official national language and the primary language taught in schools . english and spanish are also part of the official curriculum . the city has six international schools : american school of brasília , brasília international school ( bis ) , escola das nações , swiss international school ( sis ) , lycée français françois-mitterrand ( lffm ) and maple bear canadian school . august 2016 will see the opening of a new international school - the british school of brasilia . brasília has two universities , three university centers , and many private colleges .
during the french revolution , and soon after , in germany ( by the left hegelians ) , humanism began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind , without attention to the transcendent or supernatural . the designation religious humanism refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . it is similar to protestantism , although centered on human needs , interests , and abilities rather than the supernatural . in the anglophone world , such modern , organized forms of humanism , which are rooted in the 18th-century enlightenment , have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with classical learning and the liberal arts .
when not dressed in westernized clothing such as jeans and t-shirts , somali men typically wear the macawis , which is a sarong-like garment worn around the waist . on their heads , they often wrap a colorful turban or wear the koofiyad , an embroidered fez .
kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures , or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves . over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as " descent " , " descent groups " , " lineages " , " affines " , " cognates " , and even " fictive kinship " . broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ( one 's social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage .
she met director guy ritchie , who would become her second husband , in november 1998 and gave birth to their son rocco john ritchie on august 11 , 2000 in los angeles . rocco and madonna suffered complications from the birth due to her experiencing placenta praevia . he was christened at dornoch cathedral in dornoch , scotland , on december 21 , 2000 . madonna married ritchie the following day at nearby skibo castle . her fifth concert tour , titled drowned world tour , started in june 2001 . the tour visited cities in the u.s. and europe and was the highest-grossing concert tour of the year by a solo artist , earning $ 75 million from 47 sold-out shows . she also released her second greatest-hits collection , titled ghv2 , to coincide with the home video release of the tour . ghv2 debuted at number seven on the billboard 200 .
although chartered as a university , for many years washington university functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th street and washington avenue in the heart of downtown st. louis . owing to limited financial resources , washington university initially used public buildings . classes began on october 22 , 1854 , at the benton school building . at first the university paid for the evening classes , but as their popularity grew , their funding was transferred to the st. louis public schools . eventually the board secured funds for the construction of academic hall and a half dozen other buildings . later the university divided into three departments : the manual training school , smith academy , and the mary institute .
governments of republic of turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide , typically arguing either that those armenians who died were simply in the way of a war or that killings of armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the ottoman empire . passage of legislation in various foreign countries condemning the persecution of the armenians as genocide has often provoked diplomatic conflict . ( see recognition of the armenian genocide )
poland 's aa defences were no match for the german attack and the situation was similar in other european countries . significant aa warfare started with the battle of britain in the summer of 1940 . 3.7-inch haa were to provide the backbone of the groundbased aa defences , although initially significant numbers of 3-inch 20-cwt were also used . the army 's anti-aircraft command , which was under command of the air defence uk organisation , grew to 12 aa divisions in 3 aa corps . 40-mm bofors entered service in increasing numbers . in addition the raf regiment was formed in 1941 with responsibility for airfield air defence , eventually with bofors 40mm as their main armament . fixed aa defences , using haa and laa , were established by the army in key overseas places , notably malta , suez canal and singapore .
the development of new imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers . the commercial colonization of india commenced in 1757 , after the battle of plassey , when the nawab of bengal surrendered his dominions to the british east india company , in 1765 , when the company was granted the diwani , or the right to collect revenue , in bengal and bihar , or in 1772 , when the company established a capital in calcutta , appointed its first governor-general , warren hastings , and became directly involved in governance .
after the austro-turkish war of 1716–1718 the treaty of passarowitz confirmed the loss of the banat , serbia and " little walachia " ( oltenia ) to austria . the treaty also revealed that the ottoman empire was on the defensive and unlikely to present any further aggression in europe . the austro-russian–turkish war , which was ended by the treaty of belgrade in 1739 , resulted in the recovery of serbia and oltenia , but the empire lost the port of azov , north of the crimean peninsula , to the russians . after this treaty the ottoman empire was able to enjoy a generation of peace , as austria and russia were forced to deal with the rise of prussia .
charles pollak ( born karol pollak ) , the inventor of the first electrolytic capacitors , found out that the oxide layer on an aluminum anode remained stable in a neutral or alkaline electrolyte , even when the power was switched off . in 1896 he filed a patent for an " electric liquid capacitor with aluminum electrodes . " solid electrolyte tantalum capacitors were invented by bell laboratories in the early 1950s as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement their newly invented transistor .
the most important state-owned companies headquartered in montevideo are : afe ( railways ) , ancap ( energy ) , administracion nacional de puertos ( ports ) , antel ( telecommunications ) , bhu ( savings and loan ) , brou ( bank ) , bse ( insurance ) , ose ( water & sewage ) , ute ( electricity ) . these companies operate under public law , using a legal entity defined in the uruguayan constitution called ente autonomo ( " autonomous entity " ) . the government also owns part of other companies operating under private law , such as those owned wholly or partially by the cnd ( national development corporation ) .
despite its initial opposition to the closures , until 1997 , the newspaper repeatedly called for the implementation of further thatcherite policies , such as royal mail privatisation , [ verification needed ] and social security cutbacks , with leaders such as " peter lilley is right , we ca n't carry on like this " , [ verification needed ] the paper showed hostility to the eu and approval of public spending cuts , tax cuts , and promotion of right-wing ministers to the cabinet , with leaders such as " more of the redwood , not deadwood " .
his book of healing became available in europe in partial latin translation some fifty years after its composition , under the title sufficientia , and some authors have identified a " latin avicennism " as flourishing for some time , paralleling the more influential latin averroism , but suppressed by the parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215 . avicenna 's psychology and theory of knowledge influenced william of auvergne , bishop of paris and albertus magnus , while his metaphysics had an impact on the thought of thomas aquinas .
the distinctive characteristic of gothic cathedrals of the iberian peninsula is their spatial complexity , with many areas of different shapes leading from each other . they are comparatively wide , and often have very tall arcades surmounted by low clerestories , giving a similar spacious appearance to the 'hallenkirche of germany , as at the church of the batalha monastery in portugal . many of the cathedrals are completely surrounded by chapels . like english cathedrals , each is often stylistically diverse . this expresses itself both in the addition of chapels and in the application of decorative details drawn from different sources . among the influences on both decoration and form are islamic architecture and , towards the end of the period , renaissance details combined with the gothic in a distinctive manner . the west front , as at leon cathedral , typically resembles a french west front , but wider in proportion to height and often with greater diversity of detail and a combination of intricate ornament with broad plain surfaces . at burgos cathedral there are spires of german style . the roofline often has pierced parapets with comparatively few pinnacles . there are often towers and domes of a great variety of shapes and structural invention rising above the roof .
emperor zhang 's ( r. 75–88 ad ) reign came to be viewed by later eastern han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house . subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans . with the aid of the eunuch zheng zhong ( d. 107 ad ) , emperor he ( r. 88–105 ad ) had empress dowager dou ( d. 97 ad ) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power . this was in revenge for dou 's purging of the clan of his natural mother—consort liang—and then concealing her identity from him . after emperor he 's death , his wife empress deng sui ( d. 121 ad ) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 ad .
it took about 20 years to build the city from 1911 . many elements of new delhi architecture borrow from indigenous sources ; however , they fit into a british classical/palladian tradition . the fact that there were any indigenous features in the design were due to the persistence and urging of both the viceroy lord hardinge and historians like e.b . havell .
the doctrine of the immaculate conception ( mary being conceived free from original sin ) is not to be confused with her virginal conception of her son jesus . this misunderstanding of the term immaculate conception is frequently met in the mass media . catholics believe that mary was not the product of a virginal conception herself but was the daughter of a human father and mother , traditionally known by the names of saint joachim and saint anne . in 1677 , the holy see condemned the belief that mary was virginally conceived , which had been a belief surfacing occasionally since the 4th century . the church celebrates the feast of the immaculate conception ( when mary was conceived free from original sin ) on 8 december , exactly nine months before celebrating the nativity of mary . the feast of the annunciation ( which commemorates the virginal conception and the incarnation of jesus ) is celebrated on 25 march , nine months before christmas day .
remodelling of the structure began in 1762 . after his accession to the throne in 1820 , king george iv continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small , comfortable home . while the work was in progress , in 1826 , the king decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect john nash . some furnishings were transferred from carlton house , and others had been bought in france after the french revolution . the external façade was designed keeping in mind the french neo-classical influence preferred by george iv . the cost of the renovations grew dramatically , and by 1829 the extravagance of nash 's designs resulted in his removal as architect . on the death of george iv in 1830 , his younger brother king william iv hired edward blore to finish the work . at one stage , william considered converting the palace into the new houses of parliament , after the destruction of the palace of westminster by fire in 1834 .
the writer sherrel w. stewart 's assertion that " most " african americans have significant native american heritage , is not supported by genetic researchers who have done extensive population mapping studies . the tv series on african-american ancestry , hosted by the scholar henry louis gates , jr. , had genetics scholars who discussed in detail the variety of ancestries among african americans . they noted there is popular belief in a high rate of native american admixture that is not supported by the data that has been collected . ( reference is coming )
when people define and talk about a particular conception of race , they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved . in this sense , races are said to be social constructs . these constructs develop within various legal , economic , and sociopolitical contexts , and may be the effect , rather than the cause , of major social situations . while race is understood to be a social construct by many , most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination .
in recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the cap theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency , availability and partition tolerance guarantees . a distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time , but not all three . for that reason many nosql databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency .
all of chopin 's compositions include the piano . most are for solo piano , though he also wrote two piano concertos , a few chamber pieces , and some songs to polish lyrics . his keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding ; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity . chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade . his major piano works also include mazurkas , waltzes , nocturnes , polonaises , études , impromptus , scherzos , preludes and sonatas , some published only after his death . influences on his compositional style include polish folk music , the classical tradition of j. s. bach , mozart and schubert , the music of all of whom he admired , as well as the paris salons where he was a frequent guest . his innovations in style , musical form , and harmony , and his association of music with nationalism , were influential throughout and after the late romantic period .
all england matches are broadcast with full commentary on bbc radio 5 live . from the 2008–09 season until the 2017–18 season , england 's home and away qualifiers , and friendlies both home and away are broadcast live on itv ( often with the exception of stv , the itv affiliate in central and northern scotland ) . england 's away qualifiers for the 2010 world cup were shown on setanta sports until that company 's collapse . as a result of setanta sports 's demise , england 's world cup qualifier in ukraine on 10 october 2009 was shown in the united kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only . this one-off event was the first time an england game had been screened in such a way . the number of subscribers , paying between £4.99 and £11.99 each , was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000 .
the in-no-cho filled the void left by the decline of fujiwara power . rather than being banished , the fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making . in time , many of the fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising minamoto family . while the fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne . the period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the in-no-cho and of the rise of the military class throughout the country . military might rather than civil authority dominated the government .
palawan island , between borneo and mindoro , the fifth largest and western-most philippine island , was invaded on 28 february with landings of the eighth army at puerto princesa . the japanese put up little direct defense of palawan , but cleaning up pockets of japanese resistance lasted until late april , as the japanese used their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountain jungles , dispersed as small units . throughout the philippines , u.s. forces were aided by filipino guerrillas to find and dispatch the holdouts .
menzies ran strongly against labor 's plans to nationalise the australian banking system and , following victory in the 1949 election , secured a double dissolution election for april 1951 , after the labor-controlled senate refused to pass his banking legislation . the liberal-country coalition was returned with control of the senate . the government was returned again in the 1954 election ; the formation of the anti-communist democratic labor party ( dlp ) and the consequent split in the australian labor party early in 1955 helped the liberals to another victory in december 1955 . john mcewen replaced arthur fadden as leader of the country party in march 1958 and the menzies-mcewen coalition was returned again at elections in november 1958 – their third victory against labor 's h. v. evatt . the coalition was narrowly returned against labor 's arthur calwell in the december 1961 election , in the midst of a credit squeeze . menzies stood for office for the last time in the november 1963 election , again defeating calwell , with the coalition winning back its losses in the house of representatives . menzies went on to resign from parliament on 26 january 1966 .
oklahoma is host to a diverse range of sectors including aviation , energy , transportation equipment , food processing , electronics , and telecommunications . oklahoma is an important producer of natural gas , aircraft , and food . the state ranks third in the nation for production of natural gas , is the 27th-most agriculturally productive state , and also ranks 5th in production of wheat . four fortune 500 companies and six fortune 1000 companies are headquartered in oklahoma , and it has been rated one of the most business-friendly states in the nation , with the 7th-lowest tax burden in 2007 .
the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills , such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low ( about 1 % ) . in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills , such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial rifampicin , these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes ' causing increased breakdown of the pill 's active ingredients . effects on the intestinal flora , which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon , have also been suggested , but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial . clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives .
from the early stages of christianity , belief in the virginity of mary and the virgin conception of jesus , as stated in the gospels , holy and supernatural , was used by detractors , both political and religious , as a topic for discussions , debates and writings , specifically aimed to challenge the divinity of jesus and thus christians and christianity alike . in the 2nd century , as part of the earliest anti-christian polemics , celsus suggested that jesus was the illegitimate son of a roman soldier named panthera . the views of celsus drew responses from origen , the church father in alexandria , egypt , who considered it a fabricated story . how far celsus sourced his view from jewish sources remains a subject of discussion .
the war opened in the balkans when russian troops occupied provinces in modern romania and began to cross the danube . led by omar pasha , the ottomans fought a strong defensive battle and stopped the advance at silistra . a separate action on the fort town of kars in eastern turkey led to a siege , and a turkish attempt to reinforce the garrison was destroyed by a russian fleet at sinop . fearing an ottoman collapse , france and the uk rushed forces to gallipoli . they then moved north to varna in june , arriving just in time for the russians to abandon silistra . aside from a minor skirmish at constanța there was little for the allies to do . karl marx quipped that " there they are , the french doing nothing and the british helping them as fast as possible " .
in the u.s. , copyright infringement is sometimes confronted via lawsuits in civil court , against alleged infringers directly , or against providers of services and software that support unauthorized copying . for example , major motion-picture corporation mgm studios filed suit against p2p file-sharing services grokster and streamcast for their contributory role in copyright infringement . in 2005 , the supreme court ruled in favor of mgm , holding that such services could be held liable for copyright infringement since they functioned and , indeed , willfully marketed themselves as venues for acquiring copyrighted movies . the mgm v. grokster case did not overturn the earlier sony decision , but rather clouded the legal waters ; future designers of software capable of being used for copyright infringement were warned .
from 1966 , witness publications and convention talks built anticipation of the possibility that christ 's thousand-year reign might begin in late 1975 or shortly thereafter . the number of baptisms increased significantly , from about 59,000 in 1966 to more than 297,000 in 1974 . by 1975 , the number of active members exceeded two million . membership declined during the late 1970s after expectations for 1975 were proved wrong . watch tower society literature did not state dogmatically that 1975 would definitely mark the end , but in 1980 the watch tower society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding that year .
judicial power—the power to decide cases and controversies—is vested in the supreme court and inferior courts established by congress . the judges must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate , hold office during good behavior and receive compensations that may not be diminished during their continuance in office . if a court 's judges do not have such attributes , the court may not exercise the judicial power of the united states . courts exercising the judicial power are called " constitutional courts . "
in many ancient civilizations , such as those of egypt and mesopotamia , architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the supernatural , and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler , the ruling elite , or the state itself .
after defeating the visigoths in only a few months , the umayyad caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula . beginning in 711 , the land that is now portugal became part of the vast umayyad caliphate 's empire of damascus , which stretched from the indus river in the indian sub-continent ( now pakistan ) up to the south of france , until its collapse in 750 . that year the west of the empire gained its independence under abd-ar-rahman i with the establishment of the emirate of córdoba . after almost two centuries , the emirate became the caliphate of córdoba in 929 , until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms , called taifa kingdoms .
portugal has arguably the most liberal laws concerning possession of illicit drugs in the western world . in 2001 , portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including , but not limited to , cannabis , cocaine , heroin , and lsd . while possession is legal , trafficking and possession of more than " 10 days worth of personal use " are still punishable by jail time and fines . people caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility , and may refuse treatment without consequences . despite criticism from other european nations , who stated portugal 's drug consumption would tremendously increase , overall drug use has declined along with the number of hiv infection cases , which had dropped 50 percent by 2009 . drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined , however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group .
clickjacking , also known as " ui redress attack or user interface redress attack " , is a malicious technique in which an attacker tricks a user into clicking on a button or link on another webpage while the user intended to click on the top level page . this is done using multiple transparent or opaque layers . the attacker is basically " hijacking " the clicks meant for the top level page and routing them to some other irrelevant page , most likely owned by someone else . a similar technique can be used to hijack keystrokes . carefully drafting a combination of stylesheets , iframes , buttons and text boxes , a user can be led into believing that they are typing the password or other information on some authentic webpage while it is being channeled into an invisible frame controlled by the attacker .
the gothic vault , unlike the semi-circular vault of roman and romanesque buildings , can be used to roof rectangular and irregularly shaped plans such as trapezoids . the other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle . this enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in romanesque architecture . while , structurally , use of the pointed arch gave a greater flexibility to architectural form , it also gave gothic architecture a very different and more vertical visual character than romanesque .
mendes revealed that production would begin on 8 december 2014 at pinewood studios , with filming taking seven months . mendes also confirmed several filming locations , including london , mexico city and rome . van hoytema shot the film on kodak 35 mm film stock . early filming took place at pinewood studios , and around london , with scenes variously featuring craig and harris at bond 's flat , and craig and kinnear travelling down the river thames .
on june 21 , 1880 , bell 's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance , from the roof of the franklin school in washington , d.c. , to bell at the window of his laboratory , some 213 metres ( 700 ft ) away , 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions .
scotland has a very different educational system from england and wales , though also based on comprehensive education . it has different ages of transfer , different examinations and a different philosophy of choice and provision . all publicly funded primary and secondary schools are comprehensive . the scottish government has rejected plans for specialist schools as of 2005 .
in the 6th century bce , taoist teacher lao tzu espoused a series of naturalistic concepts with some elements of humanistic philosophy . the silver rule of confucianism from analects xv.24 , is an example of ethical philosophy based on human values rather than the supernatural . humanistic thought is also contained in other confucian classics , e.g. , as recorded in zuo zhuan , ji liang says , " people is the zhu ( master , lord , dominance , owner or origin ) of gods . so , to sage kings , people first , gods second " ; neishi guo says , " gods , clever , righteous and wholehearted , comply with human . " taoist and confucian secularism contain elements of moral thought devoid of religious authority or deism however they only partly resembled our modern concept of secularism .
four states in the modern era , nebraska in 2008 , new york and kansas in 2004 , and massachusetts in 1984 , had their statutes ruled unconstitutional by state courts . the death rows of new york and massachusetts were disestablished , and attempts to restore the death penalty were unsuccessful . kansas successfully appealed state v. kleypas , the kansas supreme court decision that declared the state 's death penalty statute unconstitutional , to the united states supreme court . nebraska 's death penalty statute was rendered ineffective on february 8 , 2008 when the required method , electrocution , was ruled unconstitutional by the nebraska supreme court . in 2009 , nebraska enacted a bill that changed its method of execution to lethal injection .
in october 1997 , nintendo released a redesigned model of the snes ( the sns-101 model ) in north america for us $ 99 , which sometimes included the pack-in game super mario world 2 : yoshi 's island . like the earlier redesign of the nes ( the nes-101 model ) , the new model was slimmer and lighter than its predecessor , but it lacked s-video and rgb output , and it was among the last major snes-related releases in the region . a similarly redesigned super famicom jr. was released in japan at around the same time .
the ipod line can play several audio file formats including mp3 , aac/m4a , protected aac , aiff , wav , audible audiobook , and apple lossless . the ipod photo introduced the ability to display jpeg , bmp , gif , tiff , and png image file formats . fifth and sixth generation ipod classics , as well as third generation ipod nanos , can additionally play mpeg-4 ( h.264/mpeg-4 avc ) and quicktime video formats , with restrictions on video dimensions , encoding techniques and data-rates . originally , ipod software only worked with mac os ; ipod software for microsoft windows was launched with the second generation model . unlike most other media players , apple does not support microsoft 's wma audio format—but a converter for wma files without digital rights management ( drm ) is provided with the windows version of itunes . midi files also can not be played , but can be converted to audio files using the " advanced " menu in itunes . alternative open-source audio formats , such as ogg vorbis and flac , are not supported without installing custom firmware onto an ipod ( e.g. , rockbox ) .
during his initial campaign for governor , allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against schwarzenegger , dubbed " gropegate " . within the last five days before the election , news reports appeared in the los angeles times recounting allegations of sexual misconduct from several individual women , six of whom eventually came forward with their personal stories .
persistent heavy rain and landslides in wenchuan county and the nearby area badly affected rescue efforts . at the start of rescue operations on may 12 , 20 helicopters were deployed for the delivery of food , water , and emergency aid , and also the evacuation of the injured and reconnaissance of quake-stricken areas . by 17:37 cst on may 13 , a total of over 15,600 troops and militia reservists from the chengdu military region had joined the rescue force in the heavily affected areas . a commander reported from yingxiu town , wenchuan , that around 3,000 survivors were found , while the status of the other inhabitants ( around 9,000 ) remained unclear . the 1,300 rescuers reached the epicenter , and 300 pioneer troops reached the seat of wenchuan at about 23:30 cst . by 12:17 cst , may 14 , 2008 , communication in the seat of wenchuan was partly revived . on the afternoon of may 14 , 15 special operations troops , along with relief supplies and communications gear , parachuted into inaccessible mao county , northeast of wenchuan .
typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp , lute , vielle , and psaltery , while wind instruments included the flute family ( including recorder ) , shawm ( an early member of the oboe family ) , trumpet , and the bagpipes . simple pipe organs existed , but were largely confined to churches , although there were portable varieties . later in the period , early versions of keyboard instruments like the clavichord and harpsichord began to appear . stringed instruments such as the viol had emerged by the 16th century , as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments . printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments , as well as instruction in their use .
people of german origin are found in various places around the globe . united states is home to approximately 50 million german americans or one third of the german diaspora , making it the largest centre of german-descended people outside germany . brazil is the second largest with 5 million people claiming german ancestry . other significant centres are canada , argentina , south africa and france each accounting for at least 1 million . while the exact number of german-descended people is difficult to calculate , the available data makes it safe to claim the number is exceeding 100 million people .
in the controversial elections in 2002 , sassou won with almost 90 % of the vote cast . his two main rivals , lissouba and bernard kolelas , were prevented from competing and the only remaining credible rival , andre milongo , advised his supporters to boycott the elections and then withdrew from the race . a new constitution , agreed upon by referendum in january 2002 , granted the president new powers , extended his term to seven years , and introduced a new bicameral assembly . international observers took issue with the organization of the presidential election and the constitutional referendum , both of which were reminiscent in their organization of congo 's era of the one-party state . following the presidential elections , fighting restarted in the pool region between government forces and rebels led by pastor ntumi ; a peace treaty to end the conflict was signed in april 2003 .
beyoncé 's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the african-american community . emmett price , a professor of music at northeastern university , wrote in 2007 , that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms , saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments . in 2008 , l'oréal was accused of whitening her skin in their feria hair color advertisements , responding that " it is categorically untrue " , and in 2013 , beyoncé herself criticized h & m for their proposed " retouching " of promotional images of her , and according to vogue requested that only " natural pictures be used " .
in november 1956 , eisenhower forced an end to the combined british , french and israeli invasion of egypt in response to the suez crisis , receiving praise from egyptian president gamal abdel nasser . simultaneously he condemned the brutal soviet invasion of hungary in response to the hungarian revolution of 1956 . he publicly disavowed his allies at the united nations , and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from egypt . eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against britain and france in his memoirs , which were published in 1965 .
some evidence shows that alternatives to pesticides can be equally effective as the use of chemicals . for example , sweden has halved its use of pesticides with hardly any reduction in crops . [ unreliable source ? ] in indonesia , farmers have reduced pesticide use on rice fields by 65 % and experienced a 15 % crop increase . [ unreliable source ? ] a study of maize fields in northern florida found that the application of composted yard waste with high carbon to nitrogen ratio to agricultural fields was highly effective at reducing the population of plant-parasitic nematodes and increasing crop yield , with yield increases ranging from 10 % to 212 % ; the observed effects were long-term , often not appearing until the third season of the study .
the human development index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called " western models of development " , failure to include any ecological considerations , lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization , focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking , lack of attention to development from a global perspective , measurement error of the underlying statistics , and on the undp 's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low ' , 'medium ' , 'high ' or 'very high ' human development countries .
the somali telecommunication association ( sta ) , a watchdog organization that oversees the policy development and regulatory framework of somalia 's ict sector , reported in 2006 that there were over half a million users of internet services within the territory . there were also 22 established isps and 234 cyber cafes , with an annual growth rate of 15.6 % .
the mantoux tuberculin skin test is often used to screen people at high risk for tb . those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result . the test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis , hodgkin 's lymphoma , malnutrition , and most notably , active tuberculosis . interferon gamma release assays ( igras ) , on a blood sample , are recommended in those who are positive to the mantoux test . these are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria , so they generate fewer false-positive results . however , they are affected by m. szulgai , m. marinum , and m. kansasii . igras may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test , but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone .
( the ms 6.1 earthquake on august 30 , 2008 in southern sichuan was not part of this series because it was caused by a different fault . see 2008 panzhihua earthquake for details . )
the content including match outcomes is choreographed and the combative actions and reactions are executed in special manners designed to both protect from , yet simulate , pain . these facts were once kept highly secret , but they are now openly declared as the truth . by and large , the true nature of the content is ignored by the performing promotion in official media in order to sustain and promote the willing suspension of disbelief for the audience by maintaining an aura of verisimilitude . fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media ( i.e. , interviews ) will often directly acknowledge the fictional nature of the spectacle .
windows explorer , which has been renamed file explorer , now includes a ribbon in place of the command bar . file operation dialog boxes have been updated to provide more detailed statistics , the ability to pause file transfers , and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when copying files . a new " file history " function allows incremental revisions of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device , while storage spaces allows users to combine different sized hard disks into virtual drives and specify mirroring , parity , or no redundancy on a folder-by-folder basis .
y-gerät was the most complex system of the three . it was , in effect , an automatic beam-tracking system , operated through the bomber 's autopilot . the single approach beam along which the bomber tracked was monitored by a ground controller . the signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber 's equipment . this way the distance the bomber travelled along the beam could be precisely verified . direction-finding checks also enabled the controller to keep the crew on an exact course . the crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by issue of a code word by the ground controller , or at the conclusion of the signal transmissions which would stop . although its maximum usable range was similar to the previous systems , it was not unknown for specific buildings to be hit .
according to sahih al-bukhari , the quran was recited among levantines and iraqis , and discussed by christians and jews , before it was standardized . its language was similar to the syriac language . [ citation needed ] the quran recounts stories of many of the people and events recounted in jewish and christian sacred books ( tanakh , bible ) and devotional literature ( apocrypha , midrash ) , although it differs in many details . adam , enoch , noah , eber , shelah , abraham , lot , ishmael , isaac , jacob , joseph , job , jethro , david , solomon , elijah , elisha , jonah , aaron , moses , zechariah , john the baptist and jesus are mentioned in the quran as prophets of god ( see prophets of islam ) . in fact , moses is mentioned more in the quran than any other individual . jesus is mentioned more often in the quran than muhammad , while mary is mentioned in the quran more than the new testament . muslims believe the common elements or resemblances between the bible and other jewish and christian writings and islamic dispensations is due to their common divine source , [ citation needed ] and that the original christian or jewish texts were authentic divine revelations given to prophets .
the character of new york 's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses and townhouses and shabby tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930 . in contrast , new york city also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings . in neighborhoods such as riverdale ( in the bronx ) , ditmas park ( in brooklyn ) , and douglaston ( in queens ) , large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as tudor revival and victorian .
first , the manchus had entered " china proper " because dorgon responded decisively to wu sangui 's appeal . then , after capturing beijing , instead of sacking the city as the rebels had done , dorgon insisted , over the protests of other manchu princes , on making it the dynastic capital and reappointing most ming officials . choosing beijing as the capital had not been a straightforward decision , since no major chinese dynasty had directly taken over its immediate predecessor 's capital . keeping the ming capital and bureaucracy intact helped quickly stabilize the regime and sped up the conquest of the rest of the country . however , not all of dorgon 's policies were equally popular nor easily implemented .
the william allen white school of journalism and mass communications is recognized for its ability to prepare students to work in a variety of media when they graduate . the school offers two tracts of study : news and information and strategic communication . this professional school teaches its students reporting for print , online and broadcast , strategic campaigning for pr and advertising , photojournalism and video reporting and editing . the j-school 's students maintain various publications on campus , including the university daily kansan , jayplay magazine , kujh tv and kjhk radio . in 2008 , the fiske guide to colleges praised the ku j-school for its strength . in 2010 , the school of journalism and mass communications finished second at the prestigious hearst foundation national writing competition .
serbo-croatian was standardized in the mid-19th-century vienna literary agreement by croatian and serbian writers and philologists , decades before a yugoslav state was established . from the very beginning , there were slightly different literary serbian and croatian standards , although both were based on the same shtokavian subdialect , eastern herzegovinian . in the 20th century , serbo-croatian served as the official language of the kingdom of yugoslavia ( when it was called " serbo-croato-slovenian " ) , and later as one of the official languages of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the breakup of yugoslavia affected language attitudes , so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines . since the breakup of yugoslavia , bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in bosnia and herzegovina , and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate montenegrin standard . serbo-croatian thus generally goes by the ethnic names serbian , croatian , bosnian , and sometimes montenegrin and bunjevac .
service trials demonstrated another problem however : that ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible . at short range , the apparent target area is relatively large , the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short , allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers . at long range , the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time , so the necessary calculations can in theory be done by slide rules - though , because small errors in distance cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time , exact ranging is crucial . for the ranges and speeds that the bofors worked at , neither answer was good enough .
the simplest known circadian clock is that of the prokaryotic cyanobacteria . recent research has demonstrated that the circadian clock of synechococcus elongatus can be reconstituted in vitro with just the three proteins ( kaia , kaib , kaic ) of their central oscillator . this clock has been shown to sustain a 22-hour rhythm over several days upon the addition of atp . previous explanations of the prokaryotic circadian timekeeper were dependent upon a dna transcription/translation feedback mechanism .

a spanish expedition led by captain estêvão gomes , a portuguese sailing for emperor charles v , arrived in new york harbor in january 1525 aboard the purpose-built caravel " la anunciada " and charted the mouth of the hudson river , which he named rio de san antonio . heavy ice kept him from further exploration , and he returned to spain in august . the first scientific map to show the north american east coast continuously , the 1527 world map known as the padrón real , was informed by gomes ' expedition , and labeled the northeast as tierra de esteban gómez in his honor .
subsequently with the disgrace of " near east " in diplomatic and military circles , " middle east " prevailed . however , " near east " continues in some circles at the discretion of the defining agency or academic department . they are not generally considered distinct regions as they were at their original definition .
during the rule of the fatimid and mamluk dynasties and their successor states in the medieval middle east , many of the ruling elite founded madaris through a religious endowment known as the waqf . not only was the madrasa a potent symbol of status but it was an effective means of transmitting wealth and status to their descendants . especially during the mamlūk period , when only former slaves could assume power , the sons of the ruling mamlūk elite were unable to inherit . guaranteed positions within the new madaris thus allowed them to maintain status . madaris built in this period include the mosque-madrasah of sultan ḥasan in cairo .
switzerland was the last western republic to grant women the right to vote . some swiss cantons approved this in 1959 , while at the federal level it was achieved in 1971 and , after resistance , in the last canton appenzell innerrhoden ( one of only two remaining landsgemeinde ) in 1990 . after obtaining suffrage at the federal level , women quickly rose in political significance , with the first woman on the seven member federal council executive being elisabeth kopp , who served from 1984–1989 , and the first female president being ruth dreifuss in 1999 .
german cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of max skladanowsky . it was particularly influential during the years of the weimar republic with german expressionists such as robert wiene and friedrich wilhelm murnau . the nazi era produced mostly propaganda films although the work of leni riefenstahl still introduced new aesthetics in film . from the 1960s , new german cinema directors such as volker schlöndorff , werner herzog , wim wenders , rainer werner fassbinder placed west-german cinema back onto the international stage with their often provocative films , while the deutsche film-aktiengesellschaft controlled film production in the gdr .
at the foundation of the order , the " medal of the order of the british empire " was instituted , to serve as a lower award granting recipients affiliation but not membership . in 1922 , this was renamed the " british empire medal " . it stopped being awarded by the united kingdom as part of the 1993 reforms to the honours system , but was again awarded beginning in 2012 , starting with 293 bems awarded for the queen 's diamond jubilee . in addition , the bem is awarded by the cook islands and by some other commonwealth nations . in 2004 , a report entitled " a matter of honour : reforming our honours system " by a commons committee recommended to phase out the order of the british empire , as its title was " now considered to be unacceptable , being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country ’ s population " .
from the end of world war i until 1962 , new zealand controlled samoa as a class c mandate under trusteeship through the league of nations , then through the united nations . there followed a series of new zealand administrators who were responsible for two major incidents . in the first incident , approximately one fifth of the samoan population died in the influenza epidemic of 1918–1919 . between 1919 and 1962 , samoa was administered by the department of external affairs , a government department which had been specially created to oversee new zealand 's island territories and samoa . in 1943 , this department was renamed the department of island territories after a separate department of external affairs was created to conduct new zealand 's foreign affairs .
section 6 of the endangered species act provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies . subsequently , lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state . these state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states , and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species . examples include florida , minnesota , maine , and california .
architectural interest in cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form , using simple geometric shapes , juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective . diverse elements could be superimposed , made transparent or penetrate one another , while retaining their spatial relationships . cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 ( la maison cubiste , by raymond duchamp-villon and andré mare ) onwards , developing in parallel with architects such as peter behrens and walter gropius , with the simplification of building design , the use of materials appropriate to industrial production , and the increased use of glass .
given the potential consequences , engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky , particularly for adolescents . having unprotected sex , using poor birth control methods ( e.g . withdrawal ) , having multiple sexual partners , and poor communication are some aspects of sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social risk . some qualities of adolescents ' lives that are often correlated with risky sexual behavior include higher rates of experienced abuse , lower rates of parental support and monitoring . adolescence is also commonly a time of questioning sexuality and gender . this may involve intimate experimentation with people identifying as the same gender as well as with people of differing genders . such exploratory sexual behavior can be seen as similar to other aspects of identity , including the exploration of vocational , social , and leisure identity , all of which involve some risk .
the original usb 1.0 specification , which was introduced in january 1996 , defined data transfer rates of 1.5 mbit/s " low speed " and 12 mbit/s " full speed " . microsoft windows 95 , osr 2.1 provided oem support for the devices . the first widely used version of usb was 1.1 , which was released in september 1998 . the 12 mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives , and the lower 1.5 mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as joysticks . apple inc. 's imac was the first mainstream product with usb and the imac 's success popularized usb itself . following apple 's design decision to remove all legacy ports from the imac , many pc manufacturers began building legacy-free pcs , which led to the broader pc market using usb as a standard .
the third great awakening refers to a hypothetical historical period that was marked by religious activism in american history and spans the late 1850s to the early 20th century . it affected pietistic protestant denominations and had a strong element of social activism . it gathered strength from the postmillennial belief that the second coming of christ would occur after mankind had reformed the entire earth . it was affiliated with the social gospel movement , which applied christianity to social issues and gained its force from the awakening , as did the worldwide missionary movement . new groupings emerged , such as the holiness , nazarene , and christian science movements .
napoleon turned his focus to domestic affairs after the war . empress joséphine had still not given birth to a child from napoleon , who became worried about the future of his empire following his death . desperate for a legitimate heir , napoleon divorced joséphine in january 1810 and started looking for a new wife . hoping to cement the recent alliance with austria through a family connection , napoleon married the archduchess marie louise , who was 18 years old at the time . on 20 march 1811 , marie louise gave birth to a baby boy , whom napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of king of rome . his son never actually ruled the empire , but historians still refer to him as napoleon ii .
extraordinary circumstances called for extraordinary sacrifice : in one of the many crises of the second punic war , jupiter capitolinus was promised every animal born that spring ( see ver sacrum ) , to be rendered after five more years of protection from hannibal and his allies . the " contract " with jupiter is exceptionally detailed . all due care would be taken of the animals . if any died or were stolen before the scheduled sacrifice , they would count as already sacrificed , since they had already been consecrated . normally , if the gods failed to keep their side of the bargain , the offered sacrifice would be withheld . in the imperial period , sacrifice was withheld following trajan 's death because the gods had not kept the emperor safe for the stipulated period . in pompeii , the genius of the living emperor was offered a bull : presumably a standard practise in imperial cult , though minor offerings ( incense and wine ) were also made .
on 14 june 1925 , in a spontaneous reaction against primo de rivera 's dictatorship , the crowd in the stadium jeered the royal march . as a reprisal , the ground was closed for six months and gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club . this coincided with the transition to professional football , and , in 1926 , the directors of barcelona publicly claimed , for the first time , to operate a professional football club . on 3 july 1927 , the club held a second testimonial match for paulino alcántara , against the spanish national team . to kick off the match , local journalist and pilot josep canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his airplane . in 1928 , victory in the spanish cup was celebrated with a poem titled " oda a platko " , which was written by a member of the generation of '27 , rafael alberti , inspired by the heroic performance of the barcelona goalkeeper , franz platko . on 23 june 1929 , barcelona won the inaugural spanish league . a year after winning the championship , on 30 july 1930 , gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems .
memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in american politics . one side views the war as a necessary part of the containment policy , which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare . others note the u.s. made major strategic gains as the communists were defeated in indonesia , and by 1972 both moscow and beijing were competing for american support , at the expense of their allies in hanoi . critics see the conflict as a " quagmire " —an endless waste of american blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern us interests . fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since . the draft became extremely unpopular , and president nixon ended it in 1973 , forcing the military ( the army especially ) to rely entirely upon volunteers . that raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall american society and values ; the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best american values .
its knowledge and uses spread from china through the middle east to medieval europe in the 13th century , where the first water powered paper mills were built . because of paper 's introduction to the west through the city of baghdad , it was first called bagdatikos . in the 19th century , industrial manufacture greatly lowered its cost , enabling mass exchange of information and contributing to significant cultural shifts . in 1844 , the canadian inventor charles fenerty and the german f. g. keller independently developed processes for pulping wood fibres .
the first sulfonamide and first commercially available antibacterial , prontosil , was developed by a research team led by gerhard domagk in 1932 at the bayer laboratories of the ig farben conglomerate in germany . domagk received the 1939 nobel prize for medicine for his efforts . prontosil had a relatively broad effect against gram-positive cocci , but not against enterobacteria . research was stimulated apace by its success . the discovery and development of this sulfonamide drug opened the era of antibacterials .
the riba guide to its archive and history ( 1986 ) has a section on the " statutory registration of architects " with a bibliography extending from a draft bill of 1887 to one of 1969 . the guide 's section on " education " records the setting up in 1904 of the riba board of architectural education , and the system by which any school which applied for recognition , whose syllabus was approved by the board and whose examinations were conducted by an approved external examiner , and whose standard of attainment was guaranteed by periodical inspections by a " visiting board " from the bae , could be placed on the list of " recognized schools " and its successful students could qualify for exemption from riba examinations .
engineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science . the advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life . in the first revolution , lewis paul was the original inventor of roller spinning , the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill . matthew boulton and james watt 's improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the industrial revolution in both the kingdom of great britain and the world .
the 1920s , with tourism at its peak , are considered by many historians as atlantic city 's golden age . during prohibition , which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933 , much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants . it was during prohibition that racketeer and political boss enoch l. " nucky " johnson rose to power . prohibition was largely unenforced in atlantic city , and , because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments , the resort 's popularity grew further . the city then dubbed itself as " the world 's playground " . nucky johnson 's income , which reached as much as $ 500,000 annually , came from the kickbacks he took on illegal liquor , gambling and prostitution operating in the city , as well as from kickbacks on construction projects .
the spanish empire and other europeans brought horses to the americas . some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild . the re-introduction of the horse , extinct in the americas for over 7500 years , had a profound impact on native american culture in the great plains of north america and of patagonia in south america . by domesticating horses , some tribes had great success : horses enabled them to expand their territories , exchange more goods with neighboring tribes , and more easily capture game , especially bison .
electric instruments such as the electric guitar , the electric bass and the ondes martenot appear occasionally in the classical music of the 20th and 21st centuries . both classical and popular musicians have experimented in recent decades with electronic instruments such as the synthesizer , electric and digital techniques such as the use of sampled or computer-generated sounds , and instruments from other cultures such as the gamelan .
from april 20–23 , 1989 , pre-election meetings were held in lviv for four consecutive days , drawing crowds of up to 25,000 . the action included an one-hour warning strike at eight local factories and institutions . it was the first labor strike in lviv since 1944 . on may 3 , a pre-election rally attracted 30,000 in lviv . on may 7 , the memorial society organized a mass meeting at bykivnia , site of a mass grave of ukrainian and polish victims of stalinist terror . after a march from kiev to the site , a memorial service was staged .
in the u.s. , for example , copyright case law contains a substantial similarity requirement to determine whether the work was copied . likewise , courts may require computer software to pass an abstraction-filtration-comparison test ( afc test ) to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection , or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing . software-related case law has also clarified that the amount of r & d , effort and expense put into a work 's creation does n't affect copyright protection .
mckerrow had articulated textual criticism 's goal in terms of " our ideal of an author 's fair copy of his work in its final state " . bowers asserted that editions founded on greg 's method would " represent the nearest approximation in every respect of the author 's final intentions . " bowers stated similarly that the editor 's task is to " approximate as nearly as possible an inferential authorial fair copy . " tanselle notes that , " textual criticism ... has generally been undertaken with a view to reconstructing , as accurately as possible , the text finally intended by the author " .
sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the mason–dixon line and those south of it , primarily centered on the " peculiar institution " of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government . during the 1840s and 1850s , conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent . after the election of abraham lincoln in 1860 ( who southerners thought would work to end slavery ) states in the south seceded from the united states , beginning with south carolina in late 1860 . on april 12 , 1861 , forces of the south ( known as the confederate states of america or simply the confederacy ) opened fire on fort sumter , whose garrison was loyal to the union .
the city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of eli whitney , a yale graduate who remained in new haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the hamden town line . that area is still known as whitneyville , and the main road through both towns is known as whitney avenue . the factory is now the eli whitney museum , which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the a. c. gilbert company . his factory , along with that of simeon north , and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors , contributed to making early connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy ; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as " the arsenal of america " . it was in whitney 's gun-manufacturing plant that samuel colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836 . the farmington canal , created in the early 19th century , was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of connecticut and massachusetts , and ran from new haven to northampton , massachusetts .
in japan , professional wrestling done by female wrestlers is called joshi puroresu ( 女子プロレス ) or joshi puro for short . female wrestling is usually handled by promotions that specialize in joshi puroresu rather than divisions of otherwise male-dominated promotions , as is the case in the united states . however , joshi puroresu promotions usually have agreements with male puroresu promotions such that they recognize each other 's titles as legitimate , and may share cards . all japan women 's pro-wrestling was the dominant joshi organization from the 1970s to the 1990s .
the nickname culé for a barcelona supporter is derived from the catalan cul ( english : arse ) , as the spectators at the first stadium , camp de la indústria , sat with their culs over the stand . in spain , about 25 % of the population is said to be barça sympathisers , second behind real madrid , supported by 32 % of the population . throughout europe , barcelona is the favourite second-choice club . the club 's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in september 2009 , the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of ronaldinho and then-president joan laporta 's media strategy that focused on spanish and english online media .
in addition , like most slavic languages , the shtokavian verb also has one of two aspects : perfective or imperfective . most verbs come in pairs , with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a prefix or making a stem change . the imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished , in progress , or repetitive ; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed , instantaneous , or of limited duration . some štokavian tenses ( namely , aorist and imperfect ) favor a particular aspect ( but they are rarer or absent in čakavian and kajkavian ) . actually , aspects " compensate " for the relative lack of tenses , because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time .
although kammu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan . after making temporary gains in 794 , in 797 kammu appointed a new commander , sakanoue no tamuramaro , under the title sei-i taishōgun ( barbarian-subduing generalissimo ) . by 801 the shogun had defeated the emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of honshū . imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best , however . in the ninth and tenth centuries , much authority was lost to the great families , who disregarded the chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in kyoto . stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more .
although this period had been productive , the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on chopin 's health that sand determined to leave the island . to avoid further customs duties , sand sold the piano to a local french couple , the canuts . [ n 8 ] the group traveled first to barcelona , then to marseilles , where they stayed for a few months while chopin convalesced . in may 1839 they headed for the summer to sand 's estate at nohant , where they spent most summers until 1846 . in autumn they returned to paris , where chopin 's apartment at 5 rue tronchet was close to sand 's rented accommodation at the rue pigalle . he frequently visited sand in the evenings , but both retained some independence . in 1842 he and sand moved to the square d'orléans , living in adjacent buildings .
ireland developed a strong middle class , especially in the major cities , by the mid-nineteenth century . they were active patrons of department stores . delany 's new mart was opened in 1853 in dublin , ireland . unlike others , delany 's had not evolved gradually from a smaller shop on site . thus it could claim to be the first purpose-built department store in the world . the word department store had not been invented at that time and thus it was called the " monster house " . the store was completely destroyed in the 1916 easter rising , but reopened in 1922 .
smith 's first macintosh board was built to raskin 's design specifications : it had 64 kilobytes ( kb ) of ram , used the motorola 6809e microprocessor , and was capable of supporting a 256×256-pixel black-and-white bitmap display . bud tribble , a member of the mac team , was interested in running the apple lisa 's graphical programs on the macintosh , and asked smith whether he could incorporate the lisa 's motorola 68000 microprocessor into the mac while still keeping the production cost down . by december 1980 , smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the 68000 , but increased its speed from 5 mhz to 8 mhz ; this board also had the capacity to support a 384×256-pixel display . smith 's design used fewer ram chips than the lisa , which made production of the board significantly more cost-efficient . the final mac design was self-contained and had the complete quickdraw picture language and interpreter in 64 kb of rom – far more than most other computers ; it had 128 kb of ram , in the form of sixteen 64 kilobit ( kb ) ram chips soldered to the logicboard . though there were no memory slots , its ram was expandable to 512 kb by means of soldering sixteen ic sockets to accept 256 kb ram chips in place of the factory-installed chips . the final product 's screen was a 9-inch , 512x342 pixel monochrome display , exceeding the size of the planned screen .
the church of england declared its independence from the catholic church at the time of the elizabethan religious settlement . many of the new anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary reformed tradition . these reforms were understood by one of those most responsible for them , the then archbishop of canterbury thomas cranmer , as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging protestant traditions , namely lutheranism and calvinism . by the end of the century , the retention in anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed protestant principles .
as of 2009 , dial up , wireless and satellite services were available . dial up internet services in somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent , with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5 % . the increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various somali telecom operators , including free local in-town calls , a flat rate of $ 10 per month for unlimited calls , a low charge of $ 0.005 per minute for internet connections , and a one-time connection fee of $ 50 . global internet company , a firm jointly owned by the major somali telecommunication networks hormuud telecom , telcom somalia and nationlink , was the country 's largest isp . it was at the time the only provider of dial up services in somalia 's south-central regions . in the northern puntland and somaliland regions , online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers . among these firms was golis telecom somalia in the northeast and telesom in the northwest .
there were important quality advances in recordings specifically made for radio broadcast . in the early 1930s bell telephone laboratories and western electric announced the total reinvention of disc recording : the western electric wide range system , " the new voice of action " . the intent of the new western electric system was to improve the overall quality of disc recording and playback . the recording speed was 33 1⁄3 rpm , originally used in the western electric/erpi movie audio disc system implemented in the early warner brothers ' vitaphone " talkies " of 1927 .
the company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through energy-efficient evolution of products , and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programs . internal energy-efficiency programs reportedly save the company more than $ 3 million annually in energy-cost savings . the largest component of the company 's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through pc power management : the company expects to save $ 1.8 million in energy costs through using specialized energy-management software on a network of 50,000 pcs .
in 1682 , william penn founded the city to serve as capital of the pennsylvania colony . philadelphia played an instrumental role in the american revolution as a meeting place for the founding fathers of the united states , who signed the declaration of independence in 1776 and the constitution in 1787 . philadelphia was one of the nation 's capitals in the revolutionary war , and served as temporary u.s. capital while washington , d.c. , was under construction . in the 19th century , philadelphia became a major industrial center and railroad hub that grew from an influx of european immigrants . it became a prime destination for african-americans in the great migration and surpassed two million occupants by 1950 .
colonial records of french and spanish slave ships and sales , and plantation records in all the former colonies , often have much more information about slaves , from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories . genealogists have begun to find plantation records , court records , land deeds and other sources to trace african-american families and individuals before 1870 . as slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write , black families passed along oral histories , which have had great persistence . similarly , native americans did not generally learn to read and write english , although some did in the nineteenth century . until 1930 , census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race . when those terms were dropped , as a result of the lobbying by the southern congressional bloc , the census bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white , as was typical in segregated southern states .
short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication , dependent on regions of the frontal lobe ( especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) and the parietal lobe . long-term memory , on the other hand , is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain . the hippocampus is essential ( for learning new information ) to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory , although it does not seem to store information itself . without the hippocampus , new memories are unable to be stored into long-term memory , as learned from patient henry molaison after removal of both his hippocampi , and there will be a very short attention span . furthermore , it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning .
after annexing the county of portugal into one of the several counties that made up the kingdom of asturias , king alfonso iii of asturias knighted vimara peres , in 868 ad , as the first count of portus cale ( portugal ) . the region became known as portucale , portugale , and simultaneously portugália — the county of portugal . later the kingdom of asturias was divided into a number of christian kingdoms in northern spain due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the kings offspring . with the forced abdication of alfonso iii " the great " of asturias by his sons in 910 , the kingdom of asturias split into three separate kingdoms of león , galicia and asturias . the three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 ( león and galicia in 914 , asturias later ) under the crown of león .
starting at the transition between the middle to upper paleolithic period , some 80,000 to 70,000 years ago , some hunter-gatherers bands began to specialize , concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of ( often larger ) game and gathering a smaller selection of food . this specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools , like fishing nets and hooks and bone harpoons . the transition into the subsequent neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices . agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the middle east , asia , mesoamerica , and the andes beginning as early as 12,000 years ago .
in the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose . the ideas of pragmatism , in its various forms , developed mainly from discussions between charles sanders peirce and william james when both men were at harvard in the 1870s . james popularized the term " pragmatism " , giving peirce full credit for its patrimony , but peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking , and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of " pragmaticism " . along with its pragmatic theory of truth , this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical ( experience-based ) and rational ( concept-based ) thinking .
in turn , according to kozinski 's analysis , the contemporary rule of binding precedent became possible in the u.s. in the nineteenth century only after the creation of a clear court hierarchy ( under the judiciary acts ) , and the beginning of regular verbatim publication of u.s. appellate decisions by west publishing . the rule gradually developed , case-by-case , as an extension of the judiciary 's public policy of effective judicial administration ( that is , in order to efficiently exercise the judicial power ) . the rule of precedent is generally justified today as a matter of public policy , first , as a matter of fundamental fairness , and second , because in the absence of case law , it would be completely unworkable for every minor issue in every legal case to be briefed , argued , and decided from first principles ( such as relevant statutes , constitutional provisions , and underlying public policies ) , which in turn would create hopeless inefficiency , instability , and unpredictability , and thereby undermine the rule of law .
unicode includes a mechanism for modifying character shape that greatly extends the supported glyph repertoire . this covers the use of combining diacritical marks . they are inserted after the main character . multiple combining diacritics may be stacked over the same character . unicode also contains precomposed versions of most letter/diacritic combinations in normal use . these make conversion to and from legacy encodings simpler , and allow applications to use unicode as an internal text format without having to implement combining characters . for example , é can be represented in unicode as u+0065 ( latin small letter e ) followed by u+0301 ( combining acute accent ) , but it can also be represented as the precomposed character u+00e9 ( latin small letter e with acute ) . thus , in many cases , users have multiple ways of encoding the same character . to deal with this , unicode provides the mechanism of canonical equivalence .
cotton remained a key crop in the southern economy after emancipation and the end of the civil war in 1865 . across the south , sharecropping evolved , in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits . some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves . until mechanical cotton pickers were developed , cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton . picking cotton was a source of income for families across the south . rural and small town school systems had split vacations so children could work in the fields during " cotton-picking . "
in december 1993 , the famicom received a similar redesign . it also loads cartridges through a covered slot on the top of the unit and uses non-hardwired controllers . because hvc-101 used composite video output instead of being rf only like the hvc-001 , nintendo marketed the newer model as the av famicom ( av仕様ファミコン , eibui shiyō famikon ? ) . since the new controllers do n't have microphones on them like the second controller on the original console , certain games such as the disk system version of the legend of zelda and raid on bungeling bay will have certain tricks that can not be replicated when played on an hvc-101 famicom without a modded controller . however , the hvc-101 famicom is compatible with most nes controllers due to having the same controller port . nintendo had also released a 3d graphic capable headset . however , this peripheral was never released outside japan .

bitumen was used in early photographic technology . in 1826 or 1827 , it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature . the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera . exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble , so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained . many hours of exposure in the camera were required , making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography , but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes .

pharmaceutical fraud involves deceptions which bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company . it affects individuals and public and private insurers . there are several different schemes used to defraud the health care system which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry . these include : good manufacturing practice ( gmp ) violations , off label marketing , best price fraud , cme fraud , medicaid price reporting , and manufactured compound drugs . of this amount $ 2.5 billion was recovered through false claims act cases in fy 2010 . examples of fraud cases include the glaxosmithkline $ 3 billion settlement , pfizer $ 2.3 billion settlement and merck & co. $ 650 million settlement . damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the false claims act , most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a " whistleblower " , or relator ( law ) .
theologus autodidactus , written by the arabian polymath ibn al-nafis ( 1213–1288 ) , is the first example of a science fiction novel . it deals with various science fiction elements such as spontaneous generation , futurology , the end of the world and doomsday , resurrection , and the afterlife . rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events , ibn al-nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the scientific knowledge of biology , astronomy , cosmology and geology known in his time . ibn al-nafis ' fiction explained islamic religious teachings via science and islamic philosophy .
as of 2002 there are four areas in detroit with significant asian and asian american populations . northeast detroit has population of hmong with a smaller group of lao people . a portion of detroit next to eastern hamtramck includes bangladeshi americans , indian americans , and pakistani americans ; nearly all of the bangladeshi population in detroit lives in that area . many of those residents own small businesses or work in blue collar jobs , and the population in that area is mostly muslim . the area north of downtown detroit ; including the region around the henry ford hospital , the detroit medical center , and wayne state university ; has transient asian national origin residents who are university students or hospital workers . few of them have permanent residency after schooling ends . they are mostly chinese and indian but the population also includes filipinos , koreans , and pakistanis . in southwest detroit and western detroit there are smaller , scattered asian communities including an area in the westside adjacent to dearborn and redford township that has a mostly indian asian population , and a community of vietnamese and laotians in southwest detroit .

clovis the frank , the first king of the merovingian dynasty , made the city his capital from 508 . a gradual immigration by the franks also occurred in paris in the beginning of the frankish domination of gaul which created the parisian francien dialects . fortification of the île-de-france failed to prevent sacking by vikings in 845 but paris ' strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the siege of paris ( 885–86 ) . in 987 hugh capet , count of paris ( comte de paris ) , duke of the franks ( duc des francs ) was elected king of the franks ( roi des franks ) . under the rule of the capetian kings , paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in france .
ecuador was the site of many indigenous cultures , and civilizations of different proportions . an early sedentary culture , known as the valdivia culture , developed in the coastal region , while the caras and the quitus unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the capital quito . the cañaris near cuenca were the most advanced , and most feared by the inca , due to their fierce resistance to the incan expansion . their architecture remains were later destroyed by spaniards and the incas .
in 1961 , writer-editor stan lee revolutionized superhero comics by introducing superheroes designed to appeal to more all-ages readers than the predominantly child audiences of the medium . modern marvel 's first superhero team , the titular stars of the fantastic four # 1 ( nov. 1961 ) , broke convention with other comic book archetypes of the time by squabbling , holding grudges both deep and petty , and eschewing anonymity or secret identities in favor of celebrity status . subsequently , marvel comics developed a reputation for focusing on characterization and adult issues to a greater extent than most superhero comics before them , a quality which the new generation of older readers appreciated . this applied to the amazing spider-man title in particular , which turned out to be marvel 's most successful book . its young hero suffered from self-doubt and mundane problems like any other teenager , something readers could identify with .
the city itself is hilly , though not uniformly so . like rome , the city is said to lie on seven hills ; the lists vary , but typically include capitol hill , first hill , west seattle , beacon hill , queen anne , magnolia , and the former denny hill . the wallingford , mount baker , and crown hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well . many of the hilliest areas are near the city center , with capitol hill , first hill , and beacon hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between elliott bay and lake washington . the break in the ridge between first hill and beacon hill is man-made , the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center . the topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial harbor island ( completed 1909 ) at the mouth of the city 's industrial duwamish waterway , the terminus of the green river . the highest point within city limits is at high point in west seattle , which is roughly located near 35th ave sw and sw myrtle st. other notable hills include crown hill , view ridge/wedgwood/bryant , maple leaf , phinney ridge , mt . baker ridge and highlands/carkeek/bitterlake .
theoretical obligations between a samurai and his lord ( usually a daimyo ) increased from the genpei era to the edo era . they were strongly emphasized by the teachings of confucius and mencius ( ca 550 bc ) , which were required reading for the educated samurai class . bushido was formalized by several influential leaders and families before the edo period . bushido was an ideal , and it remained fairly uniform from the 13th century to the 19th century — the ideals of bushido transcended social class , time and geographic location of the warrior class .
a reward will be paid to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest , conviction , or revocation of a license , so long as they are not a local , state , or federal employee in the performance of official duties . the secretary may also provide reasonable and necessary costs incurred for the care of fish , wildlife , and forest service or plant pending the violation caused by the criminal . if the balance ever exceeds $ 500,000 the secretary of the treasury is required to deposit an amount equal to the excess into the cooperative endangered species conservation fund .
a typical protein-coding gene is first copied into rna as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product . :6.1 in other cases , the rna molecules are the actual functional products , as in the synthesis of ribosomal rna and transfer rna . some rnas known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function , and microrna has a regulatory role . the dna sequences from which such rnas are transcribed are known as non-coding rna genes .
southampton is a major uk port which has good transport links with the rest of the country . the m27 motorway , linking places along the south coast of england , runs just to the north of the city . the m3 motorway links the city to london and also , via a link to the a34 ( part of the european route e05 ) at winchester , with the midlands and north . the m271 motorway is a spur of the m27 , linking it with the western docks and city centre .
the context-sensitive button mechanic allows one button to serve a variety of functions , such as talking , opening doors , and pushing , pulling , and throwing objects . [ e ] the on-screen display shows what action , if any , the button will trigger , determined by the situation . for example , if link is holding a rock , the context-sensitive button will cause link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy , or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still .

traditional sports include swiss wrestling or " schwingen " . it is an old tradition from the rural central cantons and considered the national sport by some . hornussen is another indigenous swiss sport , which is like a cross between baseball and golf . steinstossen is the swiss variant of stone put , a competition in throwing a heavy stone . practiced only among the alpine population since prehistoric times , it is recorded to have taken place in basel in the 13th century . it is also central to the unspunnenfest , first held in 1805 , with its symbol the 83.5 kg stone named unspunnenstein .
it was granted its royal charter in 1837 under king william iv . supplemental charters of 1887 , 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single charter in 1971 , and there have been minor amendments since then .
the ceremonial county of somerset consists of a two-tier non-metropolitan county , which is administered by somerset county council and five district councils , and two unitary authority areas ( whose councils combine the functions of a county and a district ) . the five districts of somerset are west somerset , south somerset , taunton deane , mendip , and sedgemoor . the two unitary authorities — which were established on 1 april 1996 following the break-up of the short-lived county of avon — are north somerset , and bath & north east somerset .
at the funeral of the tenor adolphe nourrit in paris in 1839 , chopin made a rare appearance at the organ , playing a transcription of franz schubert 's lied die gestirne . on 26 july 1840 chopin and sand were present at the dress rehearsal of berlioz 's grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale , composed to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the july revolution . chopin was reportedly unimpressed with the composition .
in september 1941 , through the " action lauterbacher " plan , a ghettoisation of the remaining hanoverian jewish families began . even before the wannsee conference , on 15 december 1941 , the first jews from hanover were deported to riga . a total of 2,400 people were deported , and very few survived . during the war seven concentration camps were constructed in hanover , in which many jews were confined . of the approximately 4,800 jews who had lived in hannover in 1938 , fewer than 100 were still in the city when troops of the united states army arrived on 10 april 1945 to occupy hanover at the end of the war . [ citation needed ] today , a memorial at the opera square is a reminder of the persecution of the jews in hanover . after the war a large group of orthodox jewish survivors of the nearby bergen-belsen concentration camp settled in hanover .
neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality , especially in male dogs . spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer , affecting mammary glands , ovaries , and other reproductive organs . however , neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs , and prostate cancer in males , as well as osteosarcoma , hemangiosarcoma , cruciate ligament rupture , obesity , and diabetes mellitus in either sex .
father joseph carrier , c.s.c . was director of the science museum and the library and professor of chemistry and physics until 1874 . carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the church . one of carrier 's students was father john augustine zahm ( 1851–1921 ) who was made professor and co-director of the science department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist . zahm was active in the catholic summer school movement , which introduced catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues . his book evolution and dogma ( 1896 ) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true , and argued , moreover , that even the great church teachers thomas aquinas and augustine taught something like it . the intervention of irish american catholics in rome prevented zahm 's censure by the vatican . in 1913 , zahm and former president theodore roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the amazon .
beginning his second effort that fall , west would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album . west was significantly inspired by roseland nyc live , a 1998 live album by english trip hop group portishead , produced with the new york philharmonic orchestra . early in his career , the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production . though west had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album , the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album late registration . west collaborated with american film score composer jon brion , who served as the album 's co-executive producer for several tracks . although brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records , he and west found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre . late registration sold over 2.3 million units in the united states alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season , which had been plagued by steadily declining cd sales .
the bovington signal course 's director reported that gaddafi successfully overcame problems learning english , displaying a firm command of voice procedure . noting that gaddafi 's favourite hobbies were reading and playing football , he thought him an " amusing officer , always cheerful , hard-working , and conscientious .

"
central state-owned enterprises have accumulatively donated more than $ 48.6 million . china national petroleum corp and sinopec donated 10 million yuan each to the disaster area .
unicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text . although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings , unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems . early adopters tended to use ucs-2 ( the fixed-width two-byte precursor to utf-16 ) and later moved to utf-16 ( the variable-width current standard ) , as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-bmp characters . the best known such system is windows nt ( and its descendants , windows 2000 , windows xp , windows vista and windows 7 ) , which uses utf-16 as the sole internal character encoding . the java and .net bytecode environments , mac os x , and kde also use it for internal representation . unicode is available on windows 95 through microsoft layer for unicode , as well as on its descendants , windows 98 and windows me .
prajñā ( sanskrit ) or paññā ( pāli ) means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination , the four noble truths and the three marks of existence . prajñā is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi . it is spoken of as the principal means of attaining nirvāṇa , through its revelation of the true nature of all things as dukkha ( unsatisfactoriness ) , anicca ( impermanence ) and anatta ( not-self ) . prajñā is also listed as the sixth of the six pāramitās of the mahayana .
albert einstein is known for his theories of special relativity and general relativity . he also made important contributions to statistical mechanics , especially his mathematical treatment of brownian motion , his resolution of the paradox of specific heats , and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation . despite his reservations about its interpretation , einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and , indirectly , quantum field theory , primarily through his theoretical studies of the photon .
the vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of dna ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) . dna consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits , each composed of : a five-carbon sugar ( 2'-deoxyribose ) , a phosphate group , and one of the four bases adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine . :2.1
in 1840 , louis philippe i obtained permission from the british to return napoleon 's remains to france . on 15 december 1840 , a state funeral was held . the hearse proceeded from the arc de triomphe down the champs-élysées , across the place de la concorde to the esplanade des invalides and then to the cupola in st jérôme 's chapel , where it remained until the tomb designed by louis visconti was completed . in 1861 , napoleon 's remains were entombed in a porphyry sarcophagus in the crypt under the dome at les invalides .
the unemployment rate reached its peak of 20 % in 2005 . since then , it has decreased to 7 % in 2013 , which is only slightly above the national average . the decrease is caused on the one hand by the emergence of new jobs and on the other by a marked decrease in the working-age population , caused by emigration and low birth rates for decades . the wages in thuringia are low compared to rich bordering lands like hesse and bavaria . therefore , many thuringians are working in other german lands and even in austria and switzerland as weekly commuters . nevertheless , the demographic transition in thuringia leads to a lack of workers in some sectors . external immigration into thuringia has been encouraged by the government since about 2010 to counter this problem .
but bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests , however , such as plant bugs , stink bugs , and aphids ; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these . a 2006 study done by cornell researchers , the center for chinese agricultural policy and the chinese academy of science on bt cotton farming in china found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased , necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of gm seeds . however , a 2009 study by the chinese academy of sciences , stanford university and rutgers university refuted this . they concluded that the gm cotton effectively controlled bollworm . the secondary pests were mostly miridae ( plant bugs ) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied . moreover , the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to bt cotton adoption . a 2012 chinese study concluded that bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds , lacewings and spiders . the international service for the acquisition of agri-biotech applications ( isaaa ) said that , worldwide , gm cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011 . this was 69 % of the worldwide total area planted in cotton .
the onset of the southwest monsoon is anticipated to reach punjab by may , but since the early 1970s the weather pattern has been irregular . the spring monsoon has either skipped over the area or has caused it to rain so hard that floods have resulted . june and july are oppressively hot . although official estimates rarely place the temperature above 46 °c , newspaper sources claim that it reaches 51 °c and regularly carry reports about people who have succumbed to the heat . heat records were broken in multan in june 1993 , when the mercury was reported to have risen to 54 °c . in august the oppressive heat is punctuated by the rainy season , referred to as barsat , which brings relief in its wake . the hardest part of the summer is then over , but cooler weather does not come until late october .
there are 12 universities in switzerland , ten of which are maintained at cantonal level and usually offer a range of non-technical subjects . the first university in switzerland was founded in 1460 in basel ( with a faculty of medicine ) and has a tradition of chemical and medical research in switzerland . the biggest university in switzerland is the university of zurich with nearly 25,000 students . the two institutes sponsored by the federal government are the ethz in zürich ( founded 1855 ) and the epfl in lausanne ( founded 1969 as such , formerly an institute associated with the university of lausanne ) which both have an excellent international reputation . [ note 10 ]
the city itself is hilly , though not uniformly so . like rome , the city is said to lie on seven hills ; the lists vary , but typically include capitol hill , first hill , west seattle , beacon hill , queen anne , magnolia , and the former denny hill . the wallingford , mount baker , and crown hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well . many of the hilliest areas are near the city center , with capitol hill , first hill , and beacon hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between elliott bay and lake washington . the break in the ridge between first hill and beacon hill is man-made , the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center . the topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial harbor island ( completed 1909 ) at the mouth of the city 's industrial duwamish waterway , the terminus of the green river . the highest point within city limits is at high point in west seattle , which is roughly located near 35th ave sw and sw myrtle st. other notable hills include crown hill , view ridge/wedgwood/bryant , maple leaf , phinney ridge , mt . baker ridge and highlands/carkeek/bitterlake .
in lebanon , clashes between pro-nasser factions and supporters of staunch nasser opponent , then-president camille chamoun , culminated in civil strife by may . the former sought to unite with the uar , while the latter sought lebanon 's continued independence . nasser delegated oversight of the issue to sarraj , who provided limited aid to nasser 's lebanese supporters through money , light arms , and officer training—short of the large-scale support that chamoun alleged . nasser did not covet lebanon , seeing it as a " special case " , but sought to prevent chamoun from a second presidential term .
for whitehead the core of religion was individual . while he acknowledged that individuals can not ever be fully separated from their society , he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others . his most famous remark on religion is that " religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary , you are never religious . " whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person 's character . he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence , it is not necessarily good – an idea which he called a " dangerous delusion " ( e.g. , a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion 's adherents ) .
in 2002 , elizabeth marked her golden jubilee . her sister and mother died in february and march respectively , and the media speculated whether the jubilee would be a success or a failure . she again undertook an extensive tour of her realms , which began in jamaica in february , where she called the farewell banquet " memorable " after a power cut plunged the king 's house , the official residence of the governor-general , into darkness . as in 1977 , there were street parties and commemorative events , and monuments were named to honour the occasion . a million people attended each day of the three-day main jubilee celebration in london , and the enthusiasm shown by the public for the queen was greater than many journalists had expected .
elsewhere , remnants of the medieval water supply system devised by the friars can still be seen today . constructed in 1290 , the system carried water from conduit head ( remnants of which survive near hill lane , shirley ) some 1.7 kilometres to the site of the friary inside the town walls . the friars granted use of the water to the town in 1310 and passed on ownership of the water supply system itself in 1420 . further remains can be observed at conduit house on commercial road .
although the initial focus of the humanist scholars in the university was the discovery , exposition and insertion of ancient texts and languages into the university , and the ideas of those texts into society generally , their influence was ultimately quite progressive . the emergence of classical texts brought new ideas and led to a more creative university climate ( as the notable list of scholars above attests to ) . a focus on knowledge coming from self , from the human , has a direct implication for new forms of scholarship and instruction , and was the foundation for what is commonly known as the humanities . this disposition toward knowledge manifested in not simply the translation and propagation of ancient texts , but also their adaptation and expansion . for instance , vesalius was imperative for advocating the use of galen , but he also invigorated this text with experimentation , disagreements and further research . the propagation of these texts , especially within the universities , was greatly aided by the emergence of the printing press and the beginning of the use of the vernacular , which allowed for the printing of relatively large texts at reasonable prices .
ipods have won several awards ranging from engineering excellence , [ not in citation given ] to most innovative audio product , to fourth best computer product of 2006. ipods often receive favorable reviews ; scoring on looks , clean design , and ease of use . pc world says that ipod line has " altered the landscape for portable audio players " . several industries are modifying their products to work better with both the ipod line and the aac audio format . examples include cd copy-protection schemes , and mobile phones , such as phones from sony ericsson and nokia , which play aac files rather than wma .
in the spring of 1800 , napoleon and his troops crossed the swiss alps into italy , aiming to surprise the austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when napoleon was still in egypt . [ note 5 ] after a difficult crossing over the alps , the french army entered the plains of northern italy virtually unopposed . while one french army approached from the north , the austrians were busy with another stationed in genoa , which was besieged by a substantial force . the fierce resistance of this french army , under andré masséna , gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference . after spending several days looking for each other , the two armies finally collided at the battle of marengo on june 14 . general melas had a numerical advantage , fielding about 30,000 austrian soldiers while napoleon commanded 24,000 french troops . the battle began favorably for the austrians as their initial attack surprised the french and gradually drove them back . melas concluded that he 'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm , leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the french . however , the french lines never broke during their tactical retreat ; napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight . late in the afternoon , a full division under desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle . a series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the austrian army , which fled chaotically over the bormida river back to alessandria , leaving behind 14,000 casualties . the following day , the austrian army agreed to abandon northern italy once more with the convention of alessandria , which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region .
despite the dominance of the above formula , there are documented attempts of the financial industry , occurring before the crisis , to address the formula limitations , specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events . the volume " credit correlation : life after copulas " , published in 2007 by world scientific , summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations . see also the article by donnelly and embrechts and the book by brigo , pallavicini and torresetti , that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006 .
mass incarceration in the united states disproportionately impacts african american and latino communities . michelle alexander , author of the new jim crow : mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness ( 2010 ) , argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons . mass incarceration is also , " the larger web of laws , rules , policies , and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison . " she defines it further as " a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons , but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls " , illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color , specifically african-americans . she compares mass incarceration to jim crow laws , stating that both work as racial caste systems .
in 334 bc , alexander the great invaded the achaemenid empire , defeating the last achaemenid emperor , darius iii , at the battle of issus . following the premature death of alexander , iran came under the control of the hellenistic seleucid empire . in the middle of the 2nd century bc , the parthian empire rose to become the main power in iran , and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between romans and parthians began , culminating in the roman–parthian wars . the parthian empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries , until 224 ce , when it was succeeded by the sassanid empire . together with their neighboring arch-rival , the roman-byzantines , they made up the world 's two most dominant powers at the time , for over four centuries .
while the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism , it had the effect of introducing the concept of " function " in place of vitruvius ' " utility " . " function " came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use , perception and enjoyment of a building , not only practical but also aesthetic , psychological and cultural .
the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals . prototypes were developed by philips and sony independently in the late 1970s . in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc . after a year of experimentation and discussion , the red book cd-da standard was published in 1980 . after their commercial release in 1982 , compact discs and their players were extremely popular . despite costing up to $ 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 . the success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between philips and sony , who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware . the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged .
john , the youngest of five sons of king henry ii of england and eleanor of aquitaine , was at first not expected to inherit significant lands . following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174 , however , john became henry 's favourite child . he was appointed the lord of ireland in 1177 and given lands in england and on the continent . john 's elder brothers william , henry and geoffrey died young ; by the time richard i became king in 1189 , john was a potential heir to the throne . john unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against richard 's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the third crusade . despite this , after richard died in 1199 , john was proclaimed king of england , and came to an agreement with philip ii of france to recognise john 's possession of the continental angevin lands at the peace treaty of le goulet in 1200 .
following the death of freddie gray , beyoncé and jay-z , among other notable figures , met with his family . after the imprisonment of protesters of gray 's death , beyoncé and jay-z donated thousands of dollars to bail them out .
the evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak . some show promise including : limiting smoke exposure both in utero and after delivery , breastfeeding , and increased exposure to daycare or large families but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication . early pet exposure may be useful . results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet . dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breast feeding have not been found to be effective and thus are not recommended . reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective . it is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations effects the risk of exacerbations . immunization ; however , is recommended by the world health organization . smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma .
beyoncé 's music is generally r & b , but she also incorporates pop , soul and funk into her songs . 4 demonstrated beyoncé 's exploration of 90s-style r & b , as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases . while she almost exclusively releases english songs , beyoncé recorded several spanish songs for irreemplazable ( re-recordings of songs from b'day for a spanish-language audience ) , and the re-release of b'day . to record these , beyoncé was coached phonetically by american record producer rudy perez .
charleston is known for its unique culture , which blends traditional southern u.s. , english , french , and west african elements . the downtown peninsula has gained a reputation for its art , music , local cuisine , and fashion . spoleto festival usa , held annually in late spring , has become one of the world 's major performing arts festivals . it was founded in 1977 by pulitzer prize-winning composer gian carlo menotti , who sought to establish a counterpart to the festival dei due mondi ( the festival of two worlds ) in spoleto , italy .
on the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights stallman argues that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws , which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system , and later on , a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally , but never interfered with the freedom of average readers . still referring to copyright , he cites legal literature such as the united states constitution and case law to demonstrate that it is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain that temporarily trades property rights and free speech for public , not private , benefit in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge . he mentions that " if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time " .
the region of modern eastern europe and central eurasia ( russia , ukraine and other countries of the ex-ussr ) have a long history of christianity and christian communities on its lands . in ancient times , in the first centuries after the birth of christ , when this region was called [ by whom ? ] scythia - christians already lived there . later the region saw the first states to adopt christianity officially - initially in armenia ( 301 ad ) and in georgia ( 337 ad ) , later in the great russian principality ( kyivan rus , russian : великое княжество русское , ca 988 ad ) . people of that time used to denote themselves christians ( христиане , крестьяне ) and russians ( русские ) . both terms had strong christian connotations . [ citation needed ] it is also interesting that in time the term " крестьяне " acquired the meaning " peasants of christian faith " and later " peasants " ( the main part of the population of the region ) , while the term " христиане " retained its religious meaning and the term " русские " began to mean representatives of the heterogeneous russian nation formed on the basis of common christian faith and language , [ citation needed ] which strongly influenced the history and development of the region . in the region the " pravoslav faith " ( православная вера - orthodox faith ) or " russian faith " ( русская вера ) from earliest times became almost as known as the original " christian faith " ( христианская , крестьянская вера ) . also in some contexts the term " cossack " ( козак , казак - free man by the will of god ) was used [ by whom ? ] to denote " free " christians of steppe origin and russian language .
about 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year . it is most common in developing countries , where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year . total deaths from diarrhea are estimated at 1.26 million in 2013 – down from 2.58 million in 1990 . in 2012 , it is the second most common cause of deaths in children younger than five ( 0.76 million or 11 % ) . frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age . other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development .
most languages today , even in countries that have no direct link to greco-roman culture , use some variant of the name " neptune " for the planet . however , in chinese , japanese , and korean , the planet 's name was translated as " sea king star " ( 海王星 ) , because neptune was the god of the sea . in mongolian , neptune is called dalain van ( далайн ван ) , reflecting its namesake god 's role as the ruler of the sea . in modern greek the planet is called poseidon ( ποσειδώνας , poseidonas ) , the greek counterpart of neptune . in hebrew , " rahab " ( רהב ) , from a biblical sea monster mentioned in the book of psalms , was selected in a vote managed by the academy of the hebrew language in 2009 as the official name for the planet , even though the existing latin term " neptun " ( נפטון ) is commonly used . in māori , the planet is called tangaroa , named after the māori god of the sea . in nahuatl , the planet is called tlāloccītlalli , named after the rain god tlāloc .
murdoch found he had such a rapport with larry lamb over lunch that other potential recruits as editor were not interviewed and lamb was appointed as the first editor of the new sun . he was scathing in his opinion of the mirror , where he had recently been employed as a senior sub-editor , and shared murdoch 's view that a paper 's quality was best measured by its sales , and he regarded the mirror as overstaffed , and primarily aimed at an ageing readership . lamb hastily recruited a staff of about 125 reporters , who were mostly selected for their availability rather than their ability .
once regarded as plants constituting the class schizomycetes , bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes . unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes , bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles . although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes , the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor . these evolutionary domains are called bacteria and archaea .
112th street starts in morningside heights and runs from riverside drive to amsterdam avenue , where it meets the steps of the cathedral of saint john the divine . the street resumes at the eastern edge of morningside park and extends through harlem before ending at first avenue adjacent thomas jefferson park in east harlem . notable locations include :
in the first 200 years that black people were in the united states , they primarily identified themselves by their specific ethnic group ( closely allied to language ) and not by skin color . individuals identified themselves , for example , as ashanti , igbo , bakongo , or wolof . however , when the first captives were brought to the americas , they were often combined with other groups from west africa , and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by english colonists . in areas of the upper south , different ethnic groups were brought together . this is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region : the west african coastline stretching from senegal to angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as mozambique . a new african-american identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of european cultural heritage , resulting in fusions such as the black church and black english . this new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group . [ citation needed ] by contrast , slave records from louisiana show that the french and spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the west africans , including ethnicities and given tribal names .
in 2005 , the company sold its personal computer business to chinese technology company lenovo , and in the same year it agreed to acquire micromuse . a year later ibm launched secure blue , a low-cost hardware design for data encryption that can be built into a microprocessor . in 2009 it acquired software company spss inc. later in 2009 , ibm 's blue gene supercomputing program was awarded the national medal of technology and innovation by u.s. president barack obama . in 2011 , ibm gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program watson , which was exhibited on jeopardy ! where it won against game-show champions ken jennings and brad rutter . as of 2012 [ update ] , ibm had been the top annual recipient of u.s. patents for 20 consecutive years .
some of jackson 's successors made no use of the veto power , while others used it intermittently . it was only after the civil war that presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance congress . andrew johnson , a democrat , vetoed several reconstruction bills passed by the " radical republicans . " congress , however , managed to override fifteen of johnson 's twenty-nine vetoes . furthermore , it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the tenure of office act . the act required senate approval for the dismissal of senior cabinet officials . when johnson deliberately violated the act , which he felt was unconstitutional ( supreme court decisions later vindicated such a position ) , the house of representatives impeached him ; he was acquitted in the senate by one vote .
in the later imperial era , the burial and commemorative practises of christian and non-christians overlapped . tombs were shared by christian and non-christian family members , and the traditional funeral rites and feast of novemdialis found a part-match in the christian constitutio apostolica . the customary offers of wine and food to the dead continued ; st augustine ( following st ambrose ) feared that this invited the " drunken " practices of parentalia but commended funeral feasts as a christian opportunity to give alms of food to the poor . christians attended parentalia and its accompanying feralia and caristia in sufficient numbers for the council of tours to forbid them in ad 567 . other funerary and commemorative practices were very different . traditional roman practice spurned the corpse as a ritual pollution ; inscriptions noted the day of birth and duration of life . the christian church fostered the veneration of saintly relics , and inscriptions marked the day of death as a transition to " new life " .
the decline in the value of the u.s. dollar corresponds to price inflation , which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time . a consumer price index ( cpi ) is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households . the united states consumer price index , published by the bureau of labor statistics , is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the united states . it reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day-to-day living expenses . a graph showing the u.s. cpi relative to 1982–1984 and the annual year-over-year change in cpi is shown at right .
in march 2006 , the foundation announced a us $ 5 million grant for the international justice mission ( ijm ) , a human rights organization based in washington , d.c. , us to work in the area of sex trafficking . the official announcement explained that the grant would allow the ijm to " create a replicable model for combating sex trafficking and slavery " that would involve the opening of an office in a region with high rates of sex trafficking , following research . the office was opened for three years for the following purposes : " conducting undercover investigations , training law enforcement , rescuing victims , ensuring appropriate aftercare , and seeking perpetrator accountability " .
according to the endurance running hypothesis , long-distance running as in persistence hunting , a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times , was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics . this hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis : both subsistence strategies could have been in use – sequentially , alternating or even simultaneously .
situated between two large linguistic blocks ( ibero-romance and gallo-romance ) , catalan has many unique lexical choices , such as enyorar " to miss somebody " , apaivagar " to calm down somebody " , or rebutjar " reject " .
in january 2008 the wapping presses printed the sun for the last time and london printing was transferred to waltham cross in the borough of broxbourne in hertfordshire , where news international had built what is claimed to be the largest printing centre in europe with 12 presses . the site also produces the times and sunday times , daily telegraph and sunday telegraph , wall street journal europe ( also now a murdoch newspaper ) , london 's evening standard and local papers . northern printing had earlier been switched to a new plant at knowsley on merseyside and the scottish sun to another new plant at motherwell near glasgow . the three print centres represent a £600 million investment by ni and allowed all the titles to be produced with every page in full colour from 2008 . the waltham cross plant is capable of producing one million copies an hour of a 120-page tabloid newspaper .
the brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by congress ( articles 84 , clause viii , and 49 , clause i ) . in practice , this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty , but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of congress . additionally , the federal supreme court has ruled that , following ratification and entry into force , a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in brazil and applicable by the brazilian authorities .
in most nations with constitutions modelled after the soviet union , the legislature was given the power of being the court of last resort . in the people 's republic of china , the final power to interpret the law is vested in the standing committee of the national people 's congress ( npcsc ) . this power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of hong kong and macau , the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively . this power is a legislative power and not a judicial one in that an interpretation by the npcsc does not affect cases which have already been decided .
most of the subcontinent was conquered by the maurya empire during the 4th and 3rd centuries bce . from the 3rd century bc onwards prakrit and pali literature in the north and the sangam literature in southern india started to flourish . wootz steel originated in south india in the 3rd century bc and was exported to foreign countries . various parts of india were ruled by numerous dynasties for the next 1,500 years , among which the gupta empire stands out . this period , witnessing a hindu religious and intellectual resurgence , is known as the classical or " golden age of india " . during this period , aspects of indian civilization , administration , culture , and religion ( hinduism and buddhism ) spread to much of asia , while kingdoms in southern india had maritime business links with the roman empire from around 77 ce . indian cultural influence spread over many parts of southeast asia which led to the establishment of indianized kingdoms in southeast asia ( greater india ) .
these areas contain some spectacular scenery as well , as evidenced by such national parks as yosemite and mount rainier . west of the cascades and sierra nevada is a series of valleys , such as the central valley in california and the willamette valley in oregon . along the coast is a series of low mountain ranges known as the pacific coast ranges . much of the pacific northwest coast is inhabited by some of the densest vegetation outside of the tropics , and also the tallest trees in the world ( the redwoods ) .
antigonus then sent his son demetrius to regain control of greece . in 307 he took athens , expelling demetrius of phaleron , cassander 's governor , and proclaiming the city free again . demetrius now turned his attention to ptolemy , defeating his fleet at the battle of salamis and taking control of cyprus . in the aftermath of this victory , antigonus took the title of king ( basileus ) and bestowed it on his son demetrius poliorcetes , the rest of the diadochi soon followed suit . demetrius continued his campaigns by laying siege to rhodes and conquering most of greece in 302 , creating a league against cassander 's macedon .
there are no railways , waterways , ports or harbours on the island . loading jetties are located at kingston and cascade , but ships can not get close to either of them . when a supply ship arrives , it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches , five tonnes at a time . which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather on the day . the jetty on the leeward side of the island is often used . if the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading , the ship will move around to the other side . visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives .
the two finalists were kris allen and adam lambert , both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five . allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since season two . it was claimed , later retracted , that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from allen 's home state of arkansas alone , and that at & t employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in arkansas .
dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems . dogs have been shown to learn by inference . a study with rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items . he inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure . dogs have advanced memory skills . a study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie , " chaser " , who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words . dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing , and to understand human voice commands . dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception . a study showed compelling evidence that australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving experiment , indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans . another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task , dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human , while socialized wolves do not . modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them .
on 5 march , nasser 's security coterie arrested thousands of participants in the uprising . as a ruse to rally opposition against a return to the pre-1952 order , the rcc decreed an end to restrictions on monarchy-era parties and the free officers ' withdrawal from politics . the rcc succeeded in provoking the beneficiaries of the revolution , namely the workers , peasants , and petty bourgeois , to oppose the decrees , with one million transport workers launching a strike and thousands of peasants entering cairo in protest in late march . naguib sought to crackdown on the protesters , but his requests were rebuffed by the heads of the security forces . on 29 march , nasser announced the decrees ' revocation in response to the " impulse of the street . " between april and june , hundreds of naguib 's supporters in the military were either arrested or dismissed , and mohieddin was informally exiled to switzerland to represent the rcc abroad . king saud of saudi arabia attempted to mend relations between nasser and naguib , but to no avail .
melbourne is experiencing high population growth , generating high demand for housing . this housing boom has increased house prices and rents , as well as the availability of all types of housing . subdivision regularly occurs in the outer areas of melbourne , with numerous developers offering house and land packages . however , after 10 years [ when ? ] of planning policies to encourage medium-density and high-density development in existing areas with greater access to public transport and other services , melbourne 's middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant brownfields redevelopment .
another study on men and women 's patterns of sexual arousal confirmed that men and women have different patterns of arousal , independent of their sexual orientations . the study found that women 's genitals become aroused to both human and nonhuman stimuli from movies showing humans of both genders having sex ( heterosexual and homosexual ) and from videos showing non-human primates ( bonobos ) having sex . men did not show any sexual arousal to non-human visual stimuli , their arousal patterns being in line with their specific sexual interest ( women for heterosexual men and men for homosexual men ) .
most mutations within genes are neutral , having no effect on the organism 's phenotype ( silent mutations ) . some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid ( synonymous mutations ) . other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes , but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid ( e.g . conservative mutations ) . many mutations , however , are deleterious or even lethal , and are removed from populations by natural selection . genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual , or can be inherited . finally , a small fraction of mutations are beneficial , improving the organism 's fitness and are extremely important for evolution , since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution . :7.6
mass incarceration in the united states disproportionately impacts african american and latino communities . michelle alexander , author of the new jim crow : mass incarceration in the age of colorblindness ( 2010 ) , argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons . mass incarceration is also , " the larger web of laws , rules , policies , and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison . " she defines it further as " a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons , but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls " , illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color , specifically african-americans . she compares mass incarceration to jim crow laws , stating that both work as racial caste systems .
in india , the longest constitutional text in the history of the world has governed that country since 1950 . although the constitution of india may have been intended to provide details that would limit the opportunity for judicial discretion , the more text there is in a constitution the greater opportunity the judiciary may have to exercise judicial review . according to indian journalist harish khare , " the rule of law or rather the constitution [ is ] in danger of being supplanted by the rule of judges . "
according to most scholars , at some period after the second council the sangha began to break into separate factions . [ note 37 ] the various accounts differ as to when the actual schisms occurred . according to the dipavamsa of the pāli tradition , they started immediately after the second council , the puggalavada tradition places it in 137 an , the sarvastivada tradition of vasumitra says it was in the time of ashoka and the mahasanghika tradition places it much later , nearly 100 bce .
arsenal fans often refer to themselves as " gooners " , the name derived from the team 's nickname , " the gunners " . the fanbase is large and generally loyal , and virtually all home matches sell out ; in 2007–08 arsenal had the second-highest average league attendance for an english club ( 60,070 , which was 99.5 % of available capacity ) , and , as of 2015 , the third-highest all-time average attendance . arsenal have the seventh highest average attendance of european football clubs only behind borussia dortmund , fc barcelona , manchester united , real madrid , bayern munich , and schalke . the club 's location , adjoining wealthy areas such as canonbury and barnsbury , mixed areas such as islington , holloway , highbury , and the adjacent london borough of camden , and largely working-class areas such as finsbury park and stoke newington , has meant that arsenal 's supporters have come from a variety of social classes .
although kammu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the emishi , possible descendants of the displaced jōmon , living in northern and eastern japan . after making temporary gains in 794 , in 797 kammu appointed a new commander , sakanoue no tamuramaro , under the title sei-i taishōgun ( barbarian-subduing generalissimo ) . by 801 the shogun had defeated the emishi and had extended the imperial domains to the eastern end of honshū . imperial control over the provinces was tenuous at best , however . in the ninth and tenth centuries , much authority was lost to the great families , who disregarded the chinese-style land and tax systems imposed by the government in kyoto . stability came to japan , but , even though succession was ensured for the imperial family through heredity , power again concentrated in the hands of one noble family , the fujiwara which also helped japan develop more .
the tibetan name for their land , bod བོད་ , means " tibet " or " tibetan plateau " , although it originally meant the central region around lhasa , now known in tibetan as ü . the standard tibetan pronunciation of bod , [ pʰøʔ˨˧˨ ] , is transcribed bhö in tournadre phonetic transcription , bö in the thl simplified phonetic transcription and poi in tibetan pinyin . some scholars believe the first written reference to bod " tibet " was the ancient bautai people recorded in the egyptian greek works periplus of the erythraean sea ( 1st century ce ) and geographia ( ptolemy , 2nd century ce ) , itself from the sanskrit form bhauṭṭa of the indian geographical tradition .
the growing likelihood of war in europe dominated the early reign of george vi . the king was constitutionally bound to support prime minister neville chamberlain 's appeasement of hitler . however , when the king and queen greeted chamberlain on his return from negotiating the munich agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of buckingham palace with them . this public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional , as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family . while broadly popular among the general public , chamberlain 's policy towards hitler was the subject of some opposition in the house of commons , which led historian john grigg to describe the king 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a british sovereign in the present century " .
midtown raleigh is a residential and commercial area just north of the i-440 beltline and is part of north raleigh . it is roughly framed by glenwood/creedmoor road to the west , wake forest road to the east , and millbrook road to the north . it includes shopping centers such as north hills and crabtree valley mall . it also includes north hills park and part of the raleigh greenway system . the term was coined by the greater raleigh chamber of commerce , developer john kane and planning director mitchell silver . the news & observer newspaper started using the term for marketing purposes only . the midtown raleigh alliance was founded on july 25 , 2011 as a way for community leaders to promote the area .
a series of new editors-in-chief oversaw the company during another slow time for the industry . once again , marvel attempted to diversify , and with the updating of the comics code achieved moderate to strong success with titles themed to horror ( the tomb of dracula ) , martial arts , ( shang-chi : master of kung fu ) , sword-and-sorcery ( conan the barbarian , red sonja ) , satire ( howard the duck ) and science fiction ( 2001 : a space odyssey , " killraven " in amazing adventures , battlestar galactica , star trek , and , late in the decade , the long-running star wars series ) . some of these were published in larger-format black and white magazines , under its curtis magazines imprint . marvel was able to capitalize on its successful superhero comics of the previous decade by acquiring a new newsstand distributor and greatly expanding its comics line . marvel pulled ahead of rival dc comics in 1972 , during a time when the price and format of the standard newsstand comic were in flux . goodman increased the price and size of marvel 's november 1971 cover-dated comics from 15 cents for 36 pages total to 25 cents for 52 pages . dc followed suit , but marvel the following month dropped its comics to 20 cents for 36 pages , offering a lower-priced product with a higher distributor discount .
the axis states which assisted japan included the authoritarian government of thailand in world war ii , which quickly formed a temporary alliance with the japanese in 1941 , as the japanese forces were already invading the peninsula of southern thailand . the phayap army sent troops to invade and occupy northeastern burma , which was former thai territory that had been annexed by britain much earlier . also involved were the japanese puppet states of manchukuo and mengjiang ( consisting of most of manchuria and parts of inner mongolia respectively ) , and the collaborationist wang jingwei regime ( which controlled the coastal regions of china ) .
the style and role of any minority leader is influenced by a variety of elements , including personality and contextual factors , such as the size and cohesion of the minority party , whether his or her party controls the white house , the general political climate in the house , and the controversy that is sometimes associated with the legislative agenda . despite the variability of these factors , there are a number of institutional obligations associated with this position . many of these assignments or roles are spelled out in the house rule book . others have devolved upon the position in other ways . to be sure , the minority leader is provided with extra staff resources—beyond those accorded him or her as a representative—to assist in carrying out diverse leadership functions . worth emphasis is that there are limits on the institutional role of the minority leader , because the majority party exercises disproportionate influence over the agenda , partisan ratios on committees , staff resources , administrative operations , and the day-to-day schedule and management of floor activities .
in january 2014 , having met with secretary of state , archbishop pietro parolin , kerry said " we touched on just about every major issue that we are both working on , that are issues of concern to all of us . first of all , we talked at great length about syria , and i was particularly appreciative for the archbishop ’ s raising this issue , and equally grateful for the holy father ’ s comments – the pope 's comments yesterday regarding his support for the geneva ii process . we welcome that support . it is very important to have broad support , and i know that the pope is particularly concerned about the massive numbers of displaced human beings and the violence that has taken over 130,000 lives " .
the plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from egypt : algae ( 1483 species ) , animals ( about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects ) , fungi ( more than 627 species ) , monera ( 319 species ) , plants ( 2426 species ) , protozoans ( 371 species ) . for some major groups , for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms , the number was not known . apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians , birds , fish , mammals and reptiles , the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from egypt . for the fungi , including lichen-forming species , for example , subsequent work has shown that over 2200 species have been recorded from egypt , and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher .
when world war i broke out leading to confrontation between the ottoman empire and the russian empire in the caucasus and persian campaigns , the new government in istanbul began to look on the armenians with distrust and suspicion . this was because the imperial russian army contained a contingent of armenian volunteers . on 24 april 1915 , armenian intellectuals were arrested by ottoman authorities and , with the tehcir law ( 29 may 1915 ) , eventually a large proportion of armenians living in anatolia perished in what has become known as the armenian genocide .
on june 17 , 2015 , 21-year-old dylann roof entered the historic emanuel african methodist episcopal church during a bible study and killed nine people . senior pastor clementa pinckney , who also served as a state senator , was among those killed during the attack . the deceased also included congregation members susie jackson , 87 ; rev . daniel simmons sr. , 74 ; ethel lance , 70 ; myra thompson , 59 ; cynthia hurd , 54 ; rev . depayne middleton-doctor , 49 ; rev . sharonda coleman-singleton , 45 ; and tywanza sanders , 26 . the attack garnered national attention , and sparked a debate on historical racism , confederate symbolism in southern states , and gun violence . on july 10 , 2015 , the confederate battle flag was removed from the south carolina state house . a memorial service on the campus of the college of charleston was attended by president barack obama , michelle obama , vice president joe biden , jill biden , and speaker of the house john boehner .
in 1634 , the mughal emperor extended his hospitality to the english traders to the region of bengal , and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for the trade . the company 's mainstay businesses were by then cotton , silk , indigo dye , saltpetre , and tea . the dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the malaccan straits by ousting the portuguese in 1640–41 . with reduced portuguese and spanish influence in the region , the eic and dutch east india company ( voc ) entered a period of intense competition , resulting in the anglo-dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries .
towards the center , at the end of the groove , there is another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out . at the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle , called the lock groove ; when the stylus reaches this point , it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record . on some recordings ( for example sgt . pepper 's lonely hearts club band by the beatles , super trouper by abba and atom heart mother by pink floyd ) , the sound continues on the lock groove , which gives a strange repeating effect . automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm , as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove , to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record . precisely because of this mechanism , most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove , since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove .
everton 's biggest rivalry is with neighbours liverpool , against whom they contest the merseyside derby . the merseyside derby is usually a sellout fixture , and has been known as the " friendly derby " because both sets of fans can often be seen side by side red and blue inside the stadium both at anfield and goodison park . recently on the field , matches tend to be extremely stormy affairs ; the derby has had more red cards than any other fixture in premiership history . the rivalry stems from an internal dispute between everton officials and the owners of anfield , which was then everton 's home ground , resulting in everton moving to goodison park , and the subsequent formation of liverpool f.c. , in 1892 .
after the xinhai revolution ( 1911–12 ) toppled the qing dynasty and the last qing troops were escorted out of tibet , the new republic of china apologized for the actions of the qing and offered to restore the dalai lama 's title . the dalai lama refused any chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent tibet . in 1913 , tibet and mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition . for the next 36 years , the 13th dalai lama and the regents who succeeded him governed tibet . during this time , tibet fought chinese warlords for control of the ethnically tibetan areas in xikang and qinghai ( parts of kham and amdo ) along the upper reaches of the yangtze river . in 1914 the tibetan government signed the simla accord with britain , ceding the south tibet region to british india . the chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal .
orientation behaviour studies have been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the emlen funnel , which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues . the orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves on the walls of the cage . other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon .
child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood , interferes with their ability to attend regular school , and that is mentally , physically , socially or morally dangerous and harmful . this practice is considered exploitative by many international organisations . legislation across the world prohibit child labour . these laws do not consider all work by children as child labour ; exceptions include work by child artists , family duties , supervised training , certain categories of work such as those by amish children , some forms of child work common among indigenous american children , and others .
himachal has a rich heritage of handicrafts . these include woolen and pashmina shawls , carpets , silver and metal ware , embroidered chappals , grass shoes , kangra and gompa style paintings , wood work , horse-hair bangles , wooden and metal utensils and various other house hold items . these aesthetic and tasteful handicrafts declined under competition from machine made goods and also because of lack of marketing facilities . but now the demand for handicrafts has increased within and outside the country .
new delhi has one of india 's largest bus transport systems . buses are operated by the state-owned delhi transport corporation ( dtc ) , which owns largest fleet of compressed natural gas ( cng ) -fueled buses in the world . personal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on new delhi roads . new delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in india . taxis and auto rickshaws also ply on new delhi roads in large numbers . new delhi has one of the highest road density in india .
canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of aristotelian-thomistic legal philosophy . while the term " law " is never explicitly defined in the code , the catechism of the catholic church cites aquinas in defining law as " ... an ordinance of reason for the common good , promulgated by the one who is in charge of the community " and reformulates it as " ... a rule of conduct enacted by competent authority for the sake of the common good . "
since the beginning of the study of electricity non conductive materials like glass , porcelain , paper and mica have been used as insulators . these materials some decades later were also well-suited for further use as the dielectric for the first capacitors . paper capacitors made by sandwiching a strip of impregnated paper between strips of metal , and rolling the result into a cylinder were commonly used in the late 19century ; their manufacture started in 1876 , and they were used from the early 20th century as decoupling capacitors in telecommunications ( telephony ) .
development of a solar-powered car has been an engineering goal since the 1980s . the world solar challenge is a biannual solar-powered car race , where teams from universities and enterprises compete over 3,021 kilometres ( 1,877 mi ) across central australia from darwin to adelaide . in 1987 , when it was founded , the winner 's average speed was 67 kilometres per hour ( 42 mph ) and by 2007 the winner 's average speed had improved to 90.87 kilometres per hour ( 56.46 mph ) . the north american solar challenge and the planned south african solar challenge are comparable competitions that reflect an international interest in the engineering and development of solar powered vehicles .
there are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange , of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by bermuda 's regulatory environment . the exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities , debt issues , funds ( including hedge fund structures ) and depository receipt programmes . the bsx is a full member of the world federation of exchanges and is located in an oecd member nation . it also has approved stock exchange status under australia 's foreign investment fund ( fif ) taxation rules and designated investment exchange status by the uk 's financial services authority .
many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify , the euornithes ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi-aquatic and specialized in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . unlike the enantiornithes , which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats , most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species , waders , and swimming and diving species . the later included the superficially gull-like ichthyornis , the hesperornithiformes , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . the early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keeled breastbones , toothless , beaked portions of their jaws ( though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight .
despite conflicts with the rival monarchic chetnik movement , tito 's partisans succeeded in liberating territory , notably the " republic of užice " . during this period , tito held talks with chetnik leader draža mihailović on 19 september and 27 october 1941 . it is said that tito ordered his forces to assist escaping jews , and that more than 2,000 jews fought directly for tito .
as heirs of the dominican priory of poissy in france , the dartford sisters were also heirs to a tradition of profound learning and piety . sections of translations of spiritual writings in dartford 's library , such as suso 's little book of eternal wisdom and laurent du bois ' somme le roi , show that the " ghoostli " link to europe was not lost in the crossing of the channel . it survived in the minds of the nuns . also , the nuns shared a unique identity with poissy as a religious house founded by a royal house . the english nuns were proud of this heritage , and aware that many of them shared in england 's great history as members of the noble class , as seen in the next chapter .
interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy . while moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics , there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side-effects . therefore , potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered . despite the lack of a categorical counterindication , the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread .
during the revival , in 1809 linguist and historian josef dobrovský released a german-language grammar of old czech entitled ausführliches lehrgebäude der böhmischen sprache ( comprehensive doctrine of the bohemian language ) . dobrovský had intended his book to be descriptive , and did not think czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language . however , josef jungmann and other revivalists used dobrovský 's book to advocate for a czech linguistic revival . changes during this time included spelling reform ( notably , í in place of the former j and j in place of g ) , the use of t ( rather than ti ) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns ( which had been a late borrowing from german ) . these changes differentiated czech from slovak . modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken czech unsuitable for formal , widespread use .
the fourth a cappella musical to appear off-broadway , in transit , premiered 5 october 2010 and was produced by primary stages with book , music , and lyrics by kristen anderson-lopez , james-allen ford , russ kaplan , and sara wordsworth . set primarily in the new york city subway system its score features an eclectic mix of musical genres ( including jazz , hip hop , latin , rock , and country ) . in transit incorporates vocal beat boxing into its contemporary a cappella arrangements through the use of a subway beat boxer character . beat boxer and actor chesney snow performed this role for the 2010 primary stages production . according to the show 's website , it is scheduled to reopen for an open-ended commercial run in the fall of 2011 . in 2011 the production received four lucille lortel award nominations including outstanding musical , outer critics circle and drama league nominations , as well as five drama desk nominations including outstanding musical and won for outstanding ensemble performance .
professional wrestling shows can be considered a form of theatre in the round , with the ring , ringside area , and entryway comprising a thrust stage . however , there is a much more limited concept of a fourth wall than in most theatric performances . the audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as spectators to the sporting event being portrayed , and are encouraged to interact as such . this leads to a high level of audience participation ; in fact , their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds . often , individual matches will be part of a longer storyline conflict between " babyfaces " ( often shortened to just " faces " ) and " heels " . " faces " ( the " good guys " ) are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer , while " heels " ( the " bad guys " ) act to draw the spectators ' ire .
the predominant school of thought in the 13th century was the thomistic reconciliation of the teachings of aristotle with christian theology . the condemnation of 1277 , enacted at the university of paris , placed restrictions on ideas that could be interpreted as heretical ; restrictions that had implication for aristotelian thought . an alternative was presented by william of ockham , who insisted that the world of reason and the world of faith had to be kept apart . ockham introduced the principle of parsimony – or occam 's razor – whereby a simple theory is preferred to a more complex one , and speculation on unobservable phenomena is avoided .
nociceptive pain may also be divided into " visceral " , " deep somatic " and " superficial somatic " pain . visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch , ischemia and inflammation , but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures , such as burning and cutting . visceral pain is diffuse , difficult to locate and often referred to a distant , usually superficial , structure . it may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening , deep , squeezing , and dull . deep somatic pain is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments , tendons , bones , blood vessels , fasciae and muscles , and is dull , aching , poorly-localized pain . examples include sprains and broken bones . superficial pain is initiated by activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue , and is sharp , well-defined and clearly located . examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor ( first degree ) burns .

as of 2009 , dial up , wireless and satellite services were available . dial up internet services in somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent , with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5 % . the increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various somali telecom operators , including free local in-town calls , a flat rate of $ 10 per month for unlimited calls , a low charge of $ 0.005 per minute for internet connections , and a one-time connection fee of $ 50 . global internet company , a firm jointly owned by the major somali telecommunication networks hormuud telecom , telcom somalia and nationlink , was the country 's largest isp . it was at the time the only provider of dial up services in somalia 's south-central regions . in the northern puntland and somaliland regions , online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers . among these firms was golis telecom somalia in the northeast and telesom in the northwest .
more generally , corruption erodes the institutional capacity of government if procedures are disregarded , resources are siphoned off , and public offices are bought and sold . corruption undermines the legitimacy of government and such democratic values as trust and tolerance . recent evidence suggests that variation in the levels of corruption amongst high-income democracies can vary significantly depending on the level of accountability of decision-makers . evidence from fragile states also shows that corruption and bribery can adversely impact trust in institutions .
whitehead also described religion more technically as " an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone . " in other words , religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world , helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance . for whitehead , religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society . it is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people .
until the 1980s , the governor of the federal district was appointed by the federal government , and the laws of brasília were issued by the brazilian federal senate . with the constitution of 1988 brasília gained the right to elect its governor , and a district assembly ( câmara legislativa ) was elected to exercise legislative power . the federal district does not have a judicial power of its own . the judicial power which serves the federal district also serves federal territories . currently , brazil does not have any territories , therefore , for now the courts serve only cases from the federal district .
another civil war ensued after the death of karim khan in 1779 , out of which aqa mohammad khan emerged , founding the qajar dynasty in 1794 . in 1795 , following the disobedience of the georgian subjects and their alliance with the russians , the qajars captured tblisi by the battle of krtsanisi , and drove the russians out of the entire caucasus , reestablishing a short-lived iranian suzerainty over the region . the russo-persian wars of 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable territorial losses for iran in the caucasus , comprising all of transcaucasia and dagestan , which made part of the very concept of iran for centuries , and thus substantial gains for the neighboring russian empire .
saint barthélemy was for many years a french commune forming part of guadeloupe , which is an overseas region and department of france . through a referendum in 2003 , island residents sought separation from the administrative jurisdiction of guadeloupe , and it was finally accomplished in 2007 . the island of saint barthélemy became an overseas collectivity ( com ) . a governing territorial council was elected for its administration , which has provided the island with a certain degree of autonomy . the hotel de ville , which was the town hall , is now the hotel de la collectivité . a senator represents the island in paris . st. barthélemy has retained its free port status .
the elimination of wolves from yellowstone national park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid . without predation , herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species , affecting the area 's plant populations . in addition , wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas , which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon . the removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations , as their habitat became territory for grazing . furthermore , predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order . increased browsing on willows and conifers along blacktail creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place .
the noble eightfold path—the fourth of the buddha 's noble truths—consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions , that when developed together , lead to the cessation of dukkha . these eight factors are : right view ( or right understanding ) , right intention ( or right thought ) , right speech , right action , right livelihood , right effort , right mindfulness , and right concentration .
during his world tour of 1910–11 , bell and baldwin met with forlanini in france . they had rides in the forlanini hydrofoil boat over lake maggiore . baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying . on returning to baddeck , a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models , including the dhonnas beag , the first self-propelled bell-baldwin hydrofoil . the experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial hd-4 , powered by renault engines . a top speed of 54 miles per hour ( 87 km/h ) was achieved , with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration , good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty . in 1913 , dr. bell hired walter pinaud , a sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of pinaud 's yacht yard in westmount , nova scotia to work on the pontoons of the hd-4 . pinaud soon took over the boatyard at bell laboratories on beinn bhreagh , bell 's estate near baddeck , nova scotia . pinaud 's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the hd-4 . after the first world war , work began again on the hd-4 . bell 's report to the u.s. navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower ( 260 kilowatts ) engines in july 1919 . on september 9 , 1919 , the hd-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour ( 114.04 kilometres per hour ) , a record which stood for ten years .

because most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior ( car crashes , alcohol , unprotected sex ) , a great deal of research has been done on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking . in addressing this question , it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors ( prevalence ) , whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults ( cognitive processing perspective ) , or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions . the behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action . however , research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards , particularly social rewards , than do adults .
the next three popes , including pope emeritus benedict xvi , were created cardinals by him . his immediate successor , albino luciani , who took the name john paul i , was created a cardinal in the consistory of 5 march 1973 . karol wojtyła was created a cardinal in the consistory of 26 june 1967 . joseph ratzinger was created a cardinal in the small four-appointment consistory of 27 june 1977 , which also included bernardin gantin from benin , africa . this became the last of paul vi 's consistories before his death in august 1978 . pope paul was asked towards the end of his papacy whether he would retire at age 80 , he replied " kings can abdicate , popes can not .

new york city has a high degree of income disparity as indicated by its gini coefficient of 0.5 for the city overall and 0.6 for manhattan . the disparity is driven by wage growth in high-income brackets , while wages have stagnated for middle and lower-income brackets . in the first quarter of 2014 , the average weekly wage in new york county ( manhattan ) was $ 2,749 , representing the highest total among large counties in the united states . in 2013 , new york city had the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world , higher than the next five u.s. cities combined , including former mayor michael r. bloomberg . new york also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major u.s. cities in 2014 , at 4.6 % of residents . lower manhattan has been experiencing a baby boom , with the area south of canal street witnessing 1,086 births in 2010 , 12 % greater than 2009 and over twice the number born in 2001 .
sho-1 called for v. adm. jisaburo ozawa 's force to use an apparently vulnerable carrier force to lure the u.s. 3rd fleet away from leyte and remove air cover from the allied landing forces , which would then be attacked from the west by three japanese forces : v. adm. takeo kurita 's force would enter leyte gulf and attack the landing forces ; r. adm. shoji nishimura 's force and v. adm. kiyohide shima 's force would act as mobile strike forces . the plan was likely to result in the destruction of one or more of the japanese forces , but toyoda justified it by saying that there would be no sense in saving the fleet and losing the philippines .

schwarzenegger was born in thal , a village bordering the city of graz in styria , austria and christened arnold alois . his parents were gustav schwarzenegger ( august 17 , 1907 – december 13 , 1972 ) , and aurelia schwarzenegger ( née jadrny ; july 29 , 1922 – august 2 , 1998 ) . gustav was the local chief of police , and had served in world war ii as a hauptfeldwebel after voluntarily joining the nazi party in 1938 , though he was discharged in 1943 following a bout of malaria . he married arnold 's mother on october 20 , 1945 ; – he was 38 , and she was 23 years old . according to schwarzenegger , both of his parents were very strict : " back then in austria it was a very different world , if we did something bad or we disobeyed our parents , the rod was not spared . " he grew up in a roman catholic family who attended mass every sunday .
a strong consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike , even naïve , sense of wonder and faith , as attested by works such as close encounters of the third kind , e.t . the extra-terrestrial , hook , a.i . artificial intelligence and the bfg . according to warren buckland , these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots , which have become one of spielberg 's directing trademarks . in the cases when his films include children ( e.t . the extra-terrestrial , empire of the sun , jurassic park , etc . ) , this type of shot is more apparent , but it is also used in films like munich , saving private ryan , the terminal , minority report , and amistad . if one views each of his films , one will see this shot utilized by the director , notably the water scenes in jaws are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming . another child oriented theme in spielberg 's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age . in empire of the sun , jim , a well-groomed and spoiled english youth , loses his innocence as he suffers through world war ii china . similarly , in catch me if you can , frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them .
the basic air defence unit is typically a battery with 2 to 12 guns or missile launchers and fire control elements . these batteries , particularly with guns , usually deploy in a small area , although batteries may be split ; this is usual for some missile systems . shorad missile batteries often deploy across an area with individual launchers several kilometres apart . when manpads is operated by specialists , batteries may have several dozen teams deploying separately in small sections ; self-propelled air defence guns may deploy in pairs .

outward urban expansion is now prevented by the metropolitan green belt , although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places , resulting in a separately defined greater london urban area . beyond this is the vast london commuter belt . greater london is split for some purposes into inner london and outer london . the city is split by the river thames into north and south , with an informal central london area in its interior . the coordinates of the nominal centre of london , traditionally considered to be the original eleanor cross at charing cross near the junction of trafalgar square and whitehall , are approximately 51°30′26″n 00°07′39″w﻿ / ﻿51.50722°n 0.12750°w﻿ / 51.50722 ; -0.12750 .
the influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the enlightenment . some poetry became infused with scientific metaphor and imagery , while other poems were written directly about scientific topics . sir richard blackmore committed the newtonian system to verse in creation , a philosophical poem in seven books ( 1712 ) . after newton 's death in 1727 , poems were composed in his honour for decades . james thomson ( 1700–1748 ) penned his " poem to the memory of newton , " which mourned the loss of newton , but also praised his science and legacy .
the 2000 u.s. census in the write-in response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various write-in responses for automatic placement within the framework of the u.s. census 's enumerated races . whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races , there remains some write-in responses which fall into the " mixture " heading which can not be racially categorized . these include " bi racial , combination , everything , many , mixed , multi national , multiple , several and various " .
paleoptera and neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites , and in the neoptera , muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen . neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based ( polyneoptera and paraneoptera ) and complete metamorphosis-based groups . it has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa . for example , the paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the endopterygota than to the rest of the exopterygota . the recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders mallophaga and anoplura are derived from within psocoptera has led to the new taxon psocodea . phasmatodea and embiidina have been suggested to form the eukinolabia . mantodea , blattodea , and isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed dictyoptera .
this constitution was created when the u.s. congress directed local government to organize a constitutional convention to write the puerto rico constitution in 1951 . the acceptance of that constitution by puerto rico 's electorate , the u.s. congress , and the u.s. president occurred in 1952 . in addition , the rights , privileges and immunities attendant to united states citizens are " respected in puerto rico to the same extent as though puerto rico were a state of the union " through the express extension of the privileges and immunities clause of the u.s. constitution by the u.s. congress in 1948 .

the core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect : from sniffing over the hands of the elders ( called mangnginge in chamorro ) , the passing down of legends , chants , and courtship rituals , to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds . other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide ' canoe-making , making of the belembaotuyan ( a string musical instrument made from a gourd ) , fashioning of åcho ' atupat slings and slingstones , tool manufacture , måtan guma ' burial rituals , and preparation of herbal medicines by suruhanu .
feynman had a great deal of success teaching carl , using , for example , discussions about ants and martians as a device for gaining perspective on problems and issues . he was surprised to learn that the same teaching devices were not useful with michelle . mathematics was a common interest for father and son ; they both entered the computer field as consultants and were involved in advancing a new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problems—later known as parallel computing . the jet propulsion laboratory retained feynman as a computational consultant during critical missions . one co-worker characterized feynman as akin to don quixote at his desk , rather than at a computer workstation , ready to do battle with the windmills .

architects such as mies van der rohe , philip johnson and marcel breuer worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques , trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms , celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the industrial revolution , including steel-frame construction , which gave birth to high-rise superstructures . by mid-century , modernism had morphed into the international style , an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the twin towers of new york 's world trade center designed by minoru yamasaki .
during the cenozoic era , specifically about 25 million years ago during the miocene and pliocene epochs , the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands . existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread . the grasslands provided a new niche for mammals , including many ungulates and glires , that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets . traditionally , the spread of grasslands and the development of grazers have been strongly linked . however , an examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open , gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes in mammals , giving rise to the " grit , not grass " hypothesis .

in principle , the planck constant could be determined by examining the spectrum of a black-body radiator or the kinetic energy of photoelectrons , and this is how its value was first calculated in the early twentieth century . in practice , these are no longer the most accurate methods . the codata value quoted here is based on three watt-balance measurements of kj2rk and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon , but is mostly determined by a 2007 watt-balance measurement made at the u.s. national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) . five other measurements by three different methods were initially considered , but not included in the final refinement as they were too imprecise to affect the result .
some advocates for tibet , darfur , and the spiritual practice falun gong , planned to protest the april 9 arrival of the torch in san francisco . china had already requested the torch route in san francisco be shortened . on april 7 , 2008 , two days prior to the actual torch relay , three activists carrying tibetan flags scaled the suspension cables of the golden gate bridge to unfurl two banners , one saying " one world , one dream . free tibet " , and the other , " free tibet '08 " . among them was san francisco resident laurel sutherlin , who spoke to the local tv station kpix-cbs5 live from a cellphone , urging the international olympic committee to ask china not to allow the torch to go through tibet .

after several weeks of rumors , which started around january 11 , 2013 , dell announced on february 5 , 2013 that it had struck a $ 24.4 billion leveraged buyout deal , that would have delisted its shares from the nasdaq and hong kong stock exchange and taken it private . reuters reported that michael dell and silver lake partners , aided by a $ 2 billion loan from microsoft , would acquire the public shares at $ 13.65 apiece . the $ 24.4 billion buyout was projected to be the largest leveraged buyout backed by private equity since the 2007 financial crisis . it is also the largest technology buyout ever , surpassing the 2006 buyout of freescale semiconductor for $ 17.5 billion .
geneva and the nearby french department of ain co-host the world 's largest laboratory , cern , dedicated to particle physics research . another important research center is the paul scherrer institute . notable inventions include lysergic acid diethylamide ( lsd ) , the scanning tunneling microscope ( nobel prize ) and velcro . some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurized balloon of auguste piccard and the bathyscaphe which permitted jacques piccard to reach the deepest point of the world 's oceans .
in mid may 1967 , the soviet union issued warnings to nasser of an impending israeli attack on syria , although chief of staff mohamed fawzi considered the warnings to be " baseless " . according to kandil , without nasser 's authorization , amer used the soviet warnings as a pretext to dispatch troops to sinai on 14 may , and nasser subsequently demanded unef 's withdrawal . earlier that day , nasser received a warning from king hussein of israeli-american collusion to drag egypt into war . the message had been originally received by amer on 2 may , but was withheld from nasser until the sinai deployment on 14 may . although in the preceding months , hussein and nasser had been accusing each other of avoiding a fight with israel , hussein was nonetheless wary that an egyptian-israeli war would risk the west bank 's occupation by israel . nasser still felt that the us would restrain israel from attacking due to assurances that he received from the us and soviet union . in turn , he also reassured both powers that egypt would only act defensively .
flights are available from most countries , though direct flights are limited to mainly thai and other asean airlines . according to eleven magazine , " in the past , there were only 15 international airlines and increasing numbers of airlines have began launching direct flights from japan , qatar , taiwan , south korea , germany and singapore . " expansions were expected in september 2013 , but yet again are mainly thai and other asian-based airlines according to eleven media group 's eleven , " thailand-based nok air and business airlines and singapore-based tiger airline " .
both ac-3 and dts surround audio were clumsily implemented on laserdiscs , leading to some interesting player- and disc-dependent issues . a disc that included ac-3 audio forfeited the right analog audio channel to the modulated ac-3 rf stream . if the player did not have an ac-3 output available , the next most attractive playback option would be the digital dolby surround or stereo audio tracks . the reason for this is the rf signal needs to bypass the audio circuitry in order to be properly processed by the demodulator . if either the player did not support digital audio tracks ( common in older players ) , or the disc did not include digital audio tracks at all ( uncommon for a disc which is mastered with an ac-3 track ) , the only remaining option was to fall back to a monophonic presentation of the left analog audio track . however , many older analog-only players not only failed to output ac-3 streams correctly , but were not even aware of their potential existence . such a player will happily play the analog audio tracks verbatim , resulting in garbage ( static ) output in the right channel .

in 1880 , the newspapers news and observer combined to form the news & observer . it remains raleigh 's primary daily newspaper . the north carolina college of agriculture and mechanic arts , now known as north carolina state university , was founded as a land-grant college in 1887 . the city 's rex hospital opened in 1889 and included the state 's first nursing school . the baptist women 's college , now known as meredith college , opened in 1891 , and in 1898 , the academy of music , a private music conservatory , was established .
the production arm of the studio still struggled . while there were to be a few hits like the killers ( 1946 ) and the naked city ( 1948 ) , universal-international 's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office . by the late 1940s , goetz was out , and the studio returned to low-budget films . the inexpensive francis ( 1950 ) , the first film of a series about a talking mule and ma and pa kettle ( 1949 ) , part of a series , became mainstays of the company . once again , the films of abbott and costello , including abbott and costello meet frankenstein ( 1948 ) , were among the studio 's top-grossing productions . but at this point rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor milton rackmil , whose decca records would take full control of universal in 1952 . besides abbott and costello , the studio retained the walter lantz cartoon studio , whose product was released with universal-international 's films .
following the highly publicized incident , west took a brief break from music and threw himself into fashion , only to hole up in hawaii for the next few months writing and recording his next album . importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording , west kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments . noah callahan-bever , a writer for complex , was present during the sessions and described the " communal " atmosphere as thus : " with the right songs and the right album , he can overcome any and all controversy , and we are here to contribute , challenge , and inspire . " a variety of artists contributed to the project , including close friends jay-z , kid cudi and pusha t , as well as off-the-wall collaborations , such as with justin vernon of bon iver .
the dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of neptune is about 14 microteslas ( 0.14 g ) . the dipole magnetic moment of neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 t·m3 ( 14 μt·rn3 , where rn is the radius of neptune ) . neptune 's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components , including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength . by contrast , earth , jupiter and saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments , and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis . the large quadrupole moment of neptune may be the result of offset from the planet 's centre and geometrical constraints of the field 's dynamo generator .
when power is lost in a traction elevator system , all elevators will initially come to a halt . one by one , each car in the group will return to the lobby floor , open its doors and shut down . people in the remaining elevators may see an indicator light or hear a voice announcement informing them that the elevator will return to the lobby shortly . once all cars have successfully returned , the system will then automatically select one or more cars to be used for normal operations and these cars will return to service . the car ( s ) selected to run under emergency power can be manually overridden by a key or strip switch in the lobby . in order to help prevent entrapment , when the system detects that it is running low on power , it will bring the running cars to the lobby or nearest floor , open the doors and shut down .
in all life is problem solving , popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge – that is , how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time . this problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories , even the best of them , can not be verified by scientific testing , but can only be falsified . again , in this context the word " falsified " does not refer to something being " fake " ; rather , that something can be ( i.e. , is capable of being ) shown to be false by observation or experiment . some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false , and therefore , are not falsifiable . if so , then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge ? in popper 's view , the advance of scientific knowledge is an evolutionary process characterised by his formula :
nociceptive pain is caused by stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers that respond to stimuli approaching or exceeding harmful intensity ( nociceptors ) , and may be classified according to the mode of noxious stimulation . the most common categories are " thermal " ( e.g . heat or cold ) , " mechanical " ( e.g . crushing , tearing , shearing , etc . ) and " chemical " ( e.g . iodine in a cut or chemicals released during inflammation ) . some nociceptors respond to more than one of these modalities and are consequently designated polymodal .
the greater london council was abolished in 1986 , which left london as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration . in 2000 , london-wide government was restored , with the creation of the greater london authority . to celebrate the start of the 21st century , the millennium dome , london eye and millennium bridge were constructed . on 6 july 2005 london was awarded the 2012 summer olympics , making london the first city to stage the olympic games three times . in january 2015 , greater london 's population was estimated to be 8.63 million , the highest level since 1939 .
in the second decade of the 21st century the portuguese economy suffered its most severe recession since the 1970s resulting in the country having to be bailed out by the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund . the bailout , agreed to in 2011 , required portugal to enter into a range of austerity measures in exchange for funding support of €78 billion . in may 2014 the country exited the bailout but reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its reformist momentum . at the time of exiting the bailout the economy had contracted by 0.7 % in the first quarter of 2014 , however unemployment , while still high had fallen to 15.3 percent .
relations between the rus ' and byzantines became more complex after oleg took control over kiev , reflecting commercial , cultural , and military concerns . the wealth and income of the rus ' depended heavily upon trade with byzantium . constantine porphyrogenitus described the annual course of the princes of kiev , collecting tribute from client tribes , assembling the product into a flotilla of hundreds of boats , conducting them down the dnieper to the black sea , and sailing to the estuary of the dniester , the danube delta , and on to constantinople . on their return trip they would carry silk fabrics , spices , wine , and fruit . the importance of this trade relationship led to military action when disputes arose . the primary chronicle reports that the rus ' attacked constantinople again in 907 , probably to secure trade access . the chronicle glorifies the military prowess and shrewdness of oleg , an account imbued with legendary detail . byzantine sources do not mention the attack , but a pair of treaties in 907 and 911 set forth a trade agreement with the rus ' , the terms suggesting pressure on the byzantines , who granted the rus ' quarters and supplies for their merchants and tax-free trading privileges in constantinople .
from the rigveda until the time of pāṇini ( fourth century bce ) the development of the early vedic language can be observed in other vedic texts : the samaveda , yajurveda , atharvaveda , brahmanas , and upanishads . during this time , the prestige of the language , its use for sacred purposes , and the importance attached to its correct enunciation all served as powerful conservative forces resisting the normal processes of linguistic change . however , there is a clear , five-level linguistic development of vedic from the rigveda to the language of the upanishads and the earliest sutras such as the baudhayana sutras .
in 1592 , and again in 1597 , toyotomi hideyoshi , aiming to invade china ( 唐入り ) through korea , mobilized an army of 160,000 peasants and samurai and deployed them to korea . ( see hideyoshi 's invasions of korea , chōsen-seibatsu ( 朝鮮征伐 ? ) . taking advantage of arquebus mastery and extensive wartime experience from the sengoku period , japanese samurai armies made major gains in most of korea . kato kiyomasa advanced to orangkai territory ( present-day manchuria ) bordering korea to the northeast and crossed the border into manchuria , but withdrew after retaliatory attacks from the jurchens there , as it was clear he had outpaced the rest of the japanese invasion force . a few of the more famous samurai generals of this war were katō kiyomasa , konishi yukinaga , and shimazu yoshihiro . shimazu yoshihiro led some 7,000 samurai and , despite being heavily outnumbered , defeated a host of allied ming and korean forces at the battle of sacheon in 1598 , near the conclusion of the campaigns . yoshihiro was feared as oni-shimazu ( " shimazu ogre " ) and his nickname spread across not only korea but to ming dynasty china . in spite of the superiority of japanese land forces , ultimately the two expeditions failed ( though they did devastate the korean landmass ) from factors such as korean naval superiority ( which , led by admiral yi sun-shin , harassed japanese supply lines continuously throughout the wars , resulting in supply shortages on land ) , the commitment of sizeable ming forces to korea , korean guerrilla actions , the underestimation of resistance by japanese commanders ( in the first campaign of 1592 , korean defenses on land were caught unprepared , under-trained , and under-armed ; they were rapidly overrun , with only a limited number of successfully resistant engagements against the more-experienced and battle-hardened japanese forces - in the second campaign of 1597 , korean and ming forces proved to be a far more difficult challenge and , with the support of continued korean naval superiority , limited japanese gains to parts southeastern korea ) , and wavering japanese commitment to the campaigns as the wars dragged on . the final death blow to the japanese campaigns in korea came with hideyoshi 's death in late 1598 and the recall of all japanese forces in korea by the council of five elders ( established by hideyoshi to oversee the transition from his regency to that of his son hideyori ) .
domestically , barcelona has won 23 la liga , 27 copa del rey , 11 supercopa de españa , 3 copa eva duarte and 2 copa de la liga trophies , as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions . in international club football , barcelona has won five uefa champions league titles , a record four uefa cup winners ' cup , a shared record five uefa super cup , a record three inter-cities fairs cup and a record three fifa club world cup trophies . barcelona was ranked first in the iffhs club world ranking for 1997 , 2009 , 2011 , 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on the uefa club rankings . the club has a long-standing rivalry with real madrid ; matches between the two teams are referred to as el clásico .
corey clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record ; however , he later alleged that he and paula abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion . clark also claimed that abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair . the allegations were dismissed by fox after an independent investigation . two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – jaered andrews for an arrest on an assault charge , and frenchie davis for having previously modelled for an adult website .
southampton has always been a port , and the docks have long been a major employer in the city . in particular , it is a port for cruise ships ; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century , and in particular the inter-war years , when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the uk . today it remains home to luxury cruise ships , as well as being the largest freight port on the channel coast and fourth largest uk port by tonnage , with several container terminals . unlike some other ports , such as liverpool , london , and bristol , where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment , southampton retains much of its inner-city industry . despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre , further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009 , parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped ; the ocean village development , which included a local marina and small entertainment complex , is a good example . southampton is home to the headquarters of both the maritime and coastguard agency and the marine accident investigation branch of the department for transport in addition to cruise operator carnival uk .
one person may presume knowledge of another person 's sexual orientation based upon perceived characteristics , such as appearance , clothing , tone of voice , and accompaniment by and behavior with other people . the attempt to detect sexual orientation in social situations is known as gaydar ; some studies have found that guesses based on face photos perform better than chance . 2015 research suggests that " gaydar " is an alternate label for using lgbt stereotypes to infer orientation , and that face-shape is not an accurate indication of orientation .
in the fall of 1958 , nasser formed a tripartite committee consisting of zakaria mohieddin , al-hawrani , and salah bitar to oversee developments in syria . by moving the latter two , who were ba'athists , to cairo , he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how syria should be run . he put syria under sarraj , who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected to the introduction of egyptian agricultural reform in syria , as well as communists . following the lebanese election of fuad chehab in september 1958 , relations between lebanon and the uar improved considerably . on 25 march 1959 , chehab and nasser met at the lebanese–syrian border and compromised on an end to the lebanese crisis .
the concept of 'education through recreation ' was applied to childhood development in the 19th century . in the early 20th century , the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities . l.p. jacks , also an early proponent of lifelong learning , described education through recreation : " a master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play , his labour and his leisure , his mind and his body , his education and his recreation . he hardly knows which is which . he simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing . to himself he always seems to be doing both . enough for him that he does it well . " education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life 's activities . the concept has been revived by the university of western ontario to teach anatomy to medical students .
on 13 march 2015 , several members of the cast and crew , including craig , whishaw , wilson and mendes , as well as previous james bond actor , sir roger moore , appeared in a sketch written by david walliams and the dawson brothers for comic relief 's red nose day on bbc one . in the sketch , they film a behind-the-scenes mockumentary on the filming of spectre . the first teaser trailer for spectre was released worldwide in march 2015 , followed by the theatrical trailer in july and the final trailer in october .
on april 15 , 2013 , two chechen islamist brothers exploded two bombs near the finish line of the boston marathon , killing three people and injuring roughly 264 .
greek culture has evolved over thousands of years , with its beginning in the mycenaean civilization , continuing through the classical period , the roman and eastern roman periods and was profoundly affected by christianity , which it in turn influenced and shaped . ottoman greeks had to endure through several centuries of adversity that culminated in genocide in the 20th century but nevertheless included cultural exchanges and enriched both cultures . the diafotismos is credited with revitalizing greek culture and giving birth to the synthesis of ancient and medieval elements that characterize it today .
absolute idealism is g. w. f. hegel 's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole . hegel called his philosophy " absolute " idealism in contrast to the " subjective idealism " of berkeley and the " transcendental idealism " of kant and fichte , which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as hegel 's idealism was . the exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality , the phenomenological constitution of self-determination , the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of history .
delicate sounds and fine overtones were mostly lost , because it took a lot of sound energy to vibrate the recording horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism . there were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system . some pictures of acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances . even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn , notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback . toward the end of the acoustic era , there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns .
ann arbor has a council-manager form of government . the city council has 11 voting members : the mayor and 10 city council members . the mayor and city council members serve two-year terms : the mayor is elected every even-numbered year , while half of the city council members are up for election annually ( five in even-numbered and five in odd-numbered years ) . two council members are elected from each of the city 's five wards . the mayor is elected citywide . the mayor is the presiding officer of the city council and has the power to appoint all council committee members as well as board and commission members , with the approval of the city council . the current mayor of ann arbor is christopher taylor , a democrat who was elected as mayor in 2014 . day-to-day city operations are managed by a city administrator chosen by the city council .
when there is a potential difference across the conductors ( e.g. , when a capacitor is attached across a battery ) , an electric field develops across the dielectric , causing positive charge +q to collect on one plate and negative charge −q to collect on the other plate . if a battery has been attached to a capacitor for a sufficient amount of time , no current can flow through the capacitor . however , if a time-varying voltage is applied across the leads of the capacitor , a displacement current can flow .
on children 's day , june 1 , 2008 , many parents went to the rubble of schools to mourn for their children . the surviving children , who were mostly living in relief centres , performed ceremonies marking the special day , but also acknowledging the earthquake .
like in english , dutch has generalised the dative over the accusative case for all pronouns , e.g . du me , je , eng me , you , vs. germ mich/mir dich/dir . there is one exception : the standard language prescribes that in the third person plural , hen is to be used for the direct object , and hun for the indirect object . this distinction was artificially introduced in the 17th century by grammarians , and is largely ignored in spoken language and not well understood by dutch speakers . consequently , the third person plural forms hun and hen are interchangeable in normal usage , with hun being more common . the shared unstressed form ze is also often used as both direct and indirect objects and is a useful avoidance strategy when people are unsure which form to use .
by 30 november , the pva 13th army group managed to expel the u.s. eighth army from northwest korea . retreating from the north faster than they had counter-invaded , the eighth army crossed the 38th parallel border in mid december . un morale hit rock bottom when commanding general walton walker of the u.s. eighth army was killed on 23 december 1950 in an automobile accident . in northeast korea by 11 december , the u.s. x corps managed to cripple the pva 9th army group while establishing a defensive perimeter at the port city of hungnam . the x corps were forced to evacuate by 24 december in order to reinforce the badly depleted u.s. eighth army to the south .
the question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one . indeed , for as long as it has existed and by definition , the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention . where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital , is the government the best actor to solve this issue ? many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation , mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem . r. clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco , he believes that the " industry only responds when you threaten regulation . if industry does n't respond ( to the threat ) , you have to follow through . " on the other hand , executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary , but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently .
in australia , presbyterianism is the fourth largest denomination of christianity , with nearly 600,000 australians claiming to be presbyterian in the 2006 commonwealth census . presbyterian churches were founded in each colony , some with links to the church of scotland and others to the free church . there were also congregations originating from united presbyterian church of scotland as well as a number founded by john dunmore lang . most of these bodies merged between 1859 and 1870 , and in 1901 formed a federal union called the presbyterian church of australia but retaining their state assemblies . the presbyterian church of eastern australia representing the free church of scotland tradition , and congregations in victoria of the reformed presbyterian church , originally from ireland , are the other existing denominations dating from colonial times .
the point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically . the chicks of the synthliboramphus murrelets , like the ancient murrelet , leave the nest the night after they hatch , following their parents out to sea , where they are raised away from terrestrial predators . some other species , such as ducks , move their chicks away from the nest at an early age . in most species , chicks leave the nest just before , or soon after , they are able to fly . the amount of parental care after fledging varies ; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help , while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging . chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration .
in 1957 , braunstein further demonstrated that the rudimentary devices could be used for non-radio communication across a short distance . as noted by kroemer braunstein " .. had set up a simple optical communications link : music emerging from a record player was used via suitable electronics to modulate the forward current of a gaas diode . the emitted light was detected by a pbs diode some distance away . this signal was fed into an audio amplifier , and played back by a loudspeaker . intercepting the beam stopped the music . we had a great deal of fun playing with this setup . " this setup presaged the use of leds for optical communication applications .
each trace consists of a flat , narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching . the resistance , determined by width and thickness , of the traces must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry . power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces . in a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a ground plane for shielding and power return . for microwave circuits , transmission lines can be laid out in the form of stripline and microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance . in radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements , usually undesired ; but they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design , obviating the need for additional discrete components .
new haven 's economy originally was based in manufacturing , but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline ; the entire northeast was affected , and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations , like new haven , were hit particularly hard . simultaneously , the growth and expansion of yale university further affected the economic shift . today , over half ( 56 % ) of the city 's economy is now made up of services , in particular education and health care ; yale is the city 's largest employer , followed by yale – new haven hospital . other large employers include st. raphael hospital , smilow cancer hospital , southern connecticut state university , assa abloy manufacturing , the knights of columbus headquarters , higher one , alexion pharmaceuticals , covidien and united illuminating . yale and yale-new haven are also among the largest employers in the state , and provide more $ 100,000+-salaried positions than any other employer in connecticut .

commercial csp plants were first developed in the 1980s . since 1985 the eventually 354 mw segs csp installation , in the mojave desert of california , is the largest solar power plant in the world . other large csp plants include the 150 mw solnova solar power station and the 100 mw andasol solar power station , both in spain . the 250 mw agua caliente solar project , in the united states , and the 221 mw charanka solar park in india , are the world ’ s largest photovoltaic plants . solar projects exceeding 1 gw are being developed , but most of the deployed photovoltaics are in small rooftop arrays of less than 5 kw , which are grid connected using net metering and/or a feed-in tariff . in 2013 solar generated less than 1 % of the worlds total grid electricity .
the " radical enlightenment " promoted the concept of separating church and state , an idea that often credited to english philosopher john locke ( 1632–1704 ) . according to his principle of the social contract , locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience , as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control . for locke , this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience , which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority .
in november 2013 mgm and the mcclory estate formally settled the issue with danjaq , llc—sister company of eon productions—with mgm acquiring the full copyright film rights to the concept of spectre and all of the characters associated with it . with the acquisition of the film rights and the organisation 's re-introduction to the series ' continuity , the spectre acronym was discarded and the organisation reimagined as " spectre " .
prior to his inauguration , eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at pearl harbor addressing foremost issues ; agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term , to bring the korean war to an end , to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent , and to end price and wage controls . eisenhower also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952 ; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist russia policy . his inaugural address , as well , was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy , as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the united nations .
each team consists of a maximum of eleven players ( excluding substitutes ) , one of whom must be the goalkeeper . competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team , which is usually seven . goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms , provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal . though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield ( non-goalkeeper ) players are strategically placed by a coach , these positions are not defined or required by the laws .
on june 11 , 2006 , the british tabloid the mail on sunday reported that ipods are mainly manufactured by workers who earn no more than us $ 50 per month and work 15-hour shifts . apple investigated the case with independent auditors and found that , while some of the plant 's labour practices met apple 's code of conduct , others did not : employees worked over 60 hours a week for 35 % of the time , and worked more than six consecutive days for 25 % of the time .
cubism formed an important link between early-20th-century art and architecture . the historical , theoretical , and socio-political relationships between avant-garde practices in painting , sculpture and architecture had early ramifications in france , germany , the netherlands and czechoslovakia . though there are many points of intersection between cubism and architecture , only a few direct links between them can be drawn . most often the connections are made by reference to shared formal characteristics : faceting of form , spatial ambiguity , transparency , and multiplicity .
the federal constitution adopted in 1848 is the legal foundation of the modern federal state . it is among the oldest constitutions in the world . a new constitution was adopted in 1999 , but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure . it outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs , divides the powers between the confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority . there are three main governing bodies on the federal level : the bicameral parliament ( legislative ) , the federal council ( executive ) and the federal court ( judicial ) .

the number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000 . this compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes , showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse . the number of families in apg ( 1998 ) was 462 . in apg ii ( 2003 ) it is not settled ; at maximum it is 457 , but within this number there are 55 optional segregates , so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402 . in apg iii ( 2009 ) there are 415 families .
the industrial revolution in the midlands and northern england spelled the end for most of somerset 's cottage industries . farming continued to flourish , however , and the bath and west of england society for the encouragement of agriculture , arts , manufactures and commerce was founded in 1777 to improve farming methods . despite this , 20 years later john billingsley conducted a survey of the county 's agriculture in 1795 and found that agricultural methods could still be improved . coal mining was an important industry in north somerset during the 18th and 19th centuries , and by 1800 it was prominent in radstock . the somerset coalfield reached its peak production by the 1920s , but all the pits have now been closed , the last in 1973 . most of the surface buildings have been removed , and apart from a winding wheel outside radstock museum , little evidence of their former existence remains . further west , the brendon hills were mined for iron ore in the late 19th century ; this was taken by the west somerset mineral railway to watchet harbour for shipment to the furnaces at ebbw vale .
viking raids from 840 onwards contributed to the decline of hamwic in the 9th century , and by the 10th century a fortified settlement , which became medieval southampton , had been established .
the cold war saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm . international crises arose , such as the berlin blockade ( 1948–1949 ) , the korean war ( 1950–1953 ) , the berlin crisis of 1961 , the vietnam war ( 1959–1975 ) , the cuban missile crisis ( 1962 ) , the soviet war in afghanistan ( 1979–1989 ) and nato exercises in november 1983 . there were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought détente . direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for mutual assured destruction using deliverable nuclear weapons . in the cold war era , the generation of love and the rise of computers changed society in very different , complex ways , including higher social and local mobility .
in contrast to the fed , the ecb normally does not buy bonds outright . the normal procedure used by the ecb for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities . in these facilities , bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions : repurchase agreements , or collateralised loans . these two transactions are similar , i.e . bonds are used as collaterals for loans , the difference being of legal nature . in the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ecb until the loan is repaid .
the western edge of the oklahoma panhandle is out of alignment with its texas border . the oklahoma/new mexico border is actually 2.1 to 2.2 miles east of the texas line . the border between texas and new mexico was set first as a result of a survey by spain in 1819 . it was then set along the 103rd meridian . in the 1890s , when oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques , it was discovered that the texas line was not set along the 103rd meridian . surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819 , and the actual 103rd meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east . it was much easier to leave the mistake as it was than for texas to cede land to new mexico to correct the original surveying error . the placement of the oklahoma/new mexico border represents the true 103rd meridian .
in partnership with gardiner greene hubbard , bell helped establish the publication science during the early 1880s . in 1898 , bell was elected as the second president of the national geographic society , serving until 1903 , and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations , including photography , in the magazine . he also became a regent of the smithsonian institution ( 1898–1922 ) . the french government conferred on him the decoration of the légion d'honneur ( legion of honor ) ; the royal society of arts in london awarded him the albert medal in 1902 ; the university of würzburg , bavaria , granted him a phd , and he was awarded the franklin institute 's elliott cresson medal in 1912 . he was one of the founders of the american institute of electrical engineers in 1884 , and served as its president from 1891–92 . bell was later awarded the aiee 's edison medal in 1914 " for meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone " .
sapwood ( or alburnum ) is the younger , outermost wood ; in the growing tree it is living wood , and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves . however , by the time they become competent to conduct water , all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead . all wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood . the more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth , the larger the volume of sapwood required . hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests . sometimes trees ( of species that do form heartwood ) grown in the open may become of considerable size , 30 cm or more in diameter , before any heartwood begins to form , for example , in second-growth hickory , or open-grown pines .
on 25 june 1950 , the united nations security council unanimously condemned the north korean invasion of the republic of korea , with un security council resolution 82 . the soviet union , a veto-wielding power , had boycotted the council meetings since january 1950 , protesting that the republic of china ( taiwan ) , not the people 's republic of china , held a permanent seat in the un security council . after debating the matter , the security council , on 27 june 1950 , published resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the republic of korea . on 27 june president truman ordered u.s. air and sea forces to help the south korean regime . on 4 july the soviet deputy foreign minister accused the united states of starting armed intervention on behalf of south korea .
the world 's first institution of technology or technical university with tertiary technical education is the banská akadémia in banská štiavnica , slovakia , founded in 1735 , academy since december 13 , 1762 established by queen maria theresa in order to train specialists of silver and gold mining and metallurgy in neighbourhood . teaching started in 1764 . later the department of mathematics , mechanics and hydraulics and department of forestry were settled . university buildings are still at their place today and are used for teaching . university has launched the first book of electrotechnics in the world .
most portuguese and mestiços speak one of the african languages and kriol as second languages . french is also taught in schools because guinea-bissau is surrounded by french-speaking nations . guinea-bissau is a full member of the francophonie .
the indonesian archipelago is split by the wallace line . this line runs along what is now known to be a tectonic plate boundary , and separates asian ( western ) species from australasian ( eastern ) species . the islands between java/borneo and papua form a mixed zone , where both types occur , known as wallacea . as the pace of development accelerates and populations continue to expand in southeast asia , concern has increased regarding the impact of human activity on the region 's environment . a significant portion of southeast asia , however , has not changed greatly and remains an unaltered home to wildlife . the nations of the region , with only few exceptions , have become aware of the need to maintain forest cover not only to prevent soil erosion but to preserve the diversity of flora and fauna . indonesia , for example , has created an extensive system of national parks and preserves for this purpose . even so , such species as the javan rhinoceros face extinction , with only a handful of the animals remaining in western java .
in the conflict 's early months it appeared that gaddafi 's government – with its greater firepower – would be victorious . both sides disregarded the laws of war , committing human rights abuses , including arbitrary arrests , torture , extrajudicial executions and revenge attacks . on 26 february the united nations security council passed resolution 1970 , suspending libya from the un human rights council , implementing sanctions and calling for an international criminal court ( icc ) investigation into the killing of unarmed civilians . in march , the security council declared a no fly zone to protect the civilian population from aerial bombardment , calling on foreign nations to enforce it ; it also specifically prohibited foreign occupation . ignoring this , qatar sent hundreds of troops to support the dissidents , and along with france and the united arab emirates provided the ntc with weaponry and training .
after the xinhai revolution ( 1911–12 ) toppled the qing dynasty and the last qing troops were escorted out of tibet , the new republic of china apologized for the actions of the qing and offered to restore the dalai lama 's title . the dalai lama refused any chinese title and declared himself ruler of an independent tibet . in 1913 , tibet and mongolia concluded a treaty of mutual recognition . for the next 36 years , the 13th dalai lama and the regents who succeeded him governed tibet . during this time , tibet fought chinese warlords for control of the ethnically tibetan areas in xikang and qinghai ( parts of kham and amdo ) along the upper reaches of the yangtze river . in 1914 the tibetan government signed the simla accord with britain , ceding the south tibet region to british india . the chinese government denounced the agreement as illegal .
for decades , the u.s. federal government strenuously tried to force puerto ricans to adopt english , to the extent of making them use english as the primary language of instruction in their high schools . it was completely unsuccessful , and retreated from that policy in 1948 . puerto rico was able to maintain its spanish language , culture , and identity because the relatively small , densely populated island was already home to nearly a million people at the time of the u.s. takeover , all of those spoke spanish , and the territory was never hit with a massive influx of millions of english speakers like the vast territory acquired from mexico 50 years earlier .
in 179 bc philip died . his talented and ambitious son , perseus , took the throne and showed a renewed interest in conquering greece . with her greek allies facing a major new threat , rome declared war on macedonia again , starting the third macedonian war . perseus initially had some success against the romans . however , rome responded by sending a stronger army . this second consular army decisively defeated the macedonians at the battle of pydna in 168 bc and the macedonians duly capitulated , ending the war .
the site of richmond had been an important village of the powhatan confederacy , and was briefly settled by english colonists from jamestown in 1609 , and in 1610–1611 . the present city of richmond was founded in 1737 . it became the capital of the colony and dominion of virginia in 1780 . during the revolutionary war period , several notable events occurred in the city , including patrick henry 's " give me liberty or give me death " speech in 1775 at st. john 's church , and the passage of the virginia statute for religious freedom written by thomas jefferson . during the american civil war , richmond served as the capital of the confederate states of america . the city entered the 20th century with one of the world 's first successful electric streetcar systems , as well as a national hub of african-american commerce and culture , the jackson ward neighborhood .
the origins of the szlachta , while ancient , have always been considered obscure . :207 as a result , its members often referred to it as odwieczna ( perennial ) . :207 two popular historic theories of origin forwarded by its members and earlier historians and chroniclers involved descent from the ancient iranian tribes known as sarmatians or from japheth , one of noah 's sons ( by contrast , the peasantry were said to be the offspring of another son of noah , ham—and hence subject to bondage under the curse of ham—and the jews as the offspring of shem ) . other fanciful theories included its foundation by julius caesar , alexander the great:207 or regional leaders who had not mixed their bloodlines with those of 'slaves , prisoners , and aliens ' . :208
hopkins ' column also drew criticism on twitter , including from russell brand , to whom hopkins responded by accusing brand 's " champagne socialist humanity " of neglecting taxpayers . simon usborne , writing in the independent , compared her use of the word " cockroach " to previous uses by the nazis and just before the rwandan genocide by its perpetrators . he suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper . zoe williams commented in the guardian : " it is no joke when people start talking like this . we are not 'giving her what she wants ' when we make manifest our disgust . it is not a free speech issue . i ’ m not saying gag her : i ’ m saying fight her " .
if a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of soil and site remain unchanged , it will make its most rapid growth in youth , and gradually decline . the annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide , but later they become narrower and narrower . since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed , it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year , the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider . as a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened , thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings . in the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate . some trees , such as southern oaks , maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years . upon the whole , however , as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases .
meanwhile , the authorities in glasgow , scotland successfully petitioned the government to pass the glasgow police act establishing the city of glasgow police in 1800 . other scottish towns soon followed suit and set up their own police forces through acts of parliament . in ireland , the irish constabulary act of 1822 marked the beginning of the royal irish constabulary . the act established a force in each barony with chief constables and inspectors general under the control of the civil administration at dublin castle . by 1841 this force numbered over 8,600 men .
there are very few existing mosaics from the komnenian period but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression . the only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in constantinople is a panel in hagia sophia depicting emperor john ii and empress eirene with the theotokos ( 1122–34 ) . the empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing . it must be a lifelike portrayal because eirene was really a redhead as her original hungarian name , piroska shows . the adjacent portrait of emperor alexios i komnenos on a pier ( from 1122 ) is similarly personal . the imperial mausoleum of the komnenos dynasty , the pantokrator monastery was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed . the lack of komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent . there is only a " communion of the apostles " in the apse of the cathedral of serres .
with 120,000 students in london , the federal university of london is the largest contact teaching university in the uk . it includes four large multi-faculty universities – king 's college london , queen mary , royal holloway and ucl – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including birkbeck , the courtauld institute of art , goldsmiths , guildhall school of music and drama , the institute of education , the london business school , the london school of economics , the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine , the royal academy of music , the central school of speech and drama , the royal veterinary college and the school of oriental and african studies . members of the university of london have their own admissions procedures , and some award their own degrees .
new zealand has an annual quota of 75 tuvaluans granted work permits under the pacific access category , as announced in 2001 . the applicants register for the pacific access category ( pac ) ballots ; the primary criteria is that the principal applicant must have a job offer from a new zealand employer . tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in new zealand under the recognised seasonal employer ( rse ) work policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from tuvalu and other pacific islands . tuvaluans can participate in the australian pacific seasonal worker program , which allows pacific islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the australian agriculture industry , in particular cotton and cane operations ; fishing industry , in particular aquaculture ; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry .
in the 1990s , sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant . for cooley ( 1992 ) , pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions . during every encounter , he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the " looking glass " that the gestures and reactions of others provide . depending on these reactions , we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action . retzinger ( 1991 ) conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame . drawing predominantly on goffman and cooley 's work , scheff ( 1990 ) developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond . the formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions .
in mid-june 1940 , when international attention was focused on the german invasion of france , soviet nkvd troops raided border posts in lithuania , estonia and latvia . state administrations were liquidated and replaced by soviet cadres , in which 34,250 latvians , 75,000 lithuanians and almost 60,000 estonians were deported or killed . elections were held with single pro-soviet candidates listed for many positions , with resulting peoples assemblies immediately requesting admission into the ussr , which was granted by the soviet union . the ussr annexed the whole of lithuania , including the scheschupe area , which was to be given to germany .
aside from water , wood has three main components . cellulose , a crystalline polymer derived from glucose , constitutes about 41–43 % . next in abundance is hemicellulose , which is around 20 % in deciduous trees but near 30 % in conifers . it is mainly five-carbon sugars that are linked in an irregular manner , in contrast to the cellulose . lignin is the third component at around 27 % in coniferous wood vs. 23 % in deciduous trees . lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on aromatic rings . these three components are interwoven , and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose . a major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose , from which paper is made .
one of the primary elements of the culture of the enlightenment was the rise of the public sphere , a " realm of communication marked by new arenas of debate , more open and accessible forms of urban public space and sociability , and an explosion of print culture , " in the late 17th century and 18th century . elements of the public sphere included : it was egalitarian , it discussed the domain of " common concern , " and argument was founded on reason . habermas uses the term " common concern " to describe those areas of political/social knowledge and discussion that were previously the exclusive territory of the state and religious authorities , now open to critical examination by the public sphere . the values of this bourgeois public sphere included holding reason to be supreme , considering everything to be open to criticism ( the public sphere is critical ) , and the opposition of secrecy of all sorts .
since october 2004 , the ipod line has dominated digital music player sales in the united states , with over 90 % of the market for hard drive-based players and over 70 % of the market for all types of players . during the year from january 2004 to january 2005 , the high rate of sales caused its u.s. market share to increase from 31 % to 65 % and in july 2005 , this market share was measured at 74 % . in january 2007 the ipod market share reached 72.7 % according to bloomberg online .
the northern mariana islands had become a japanese protectorate before the war . it was the chamorros from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force . the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military . after the war , this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas . guam 's chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them , whereas having been occupied for over 30 years , the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to japan .
in ultra high vacuum systems , some very " odd " leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered . the water absorption of aluminium and palladium becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing , and even the adsorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or titanium must be considered . some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums . the permeability of the metallic chamber walls may have to be considered , and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face .
many sports are associated with new york 's immigrant communities . stickball , a street version of baseball , was popularized by youths in the 1930s , and a street in the bronx was renamed stickball boulevard in the late 2000s to memorialize this .
three main parades take place during carnival . the first is held on the first day , during which the " carnival king " ( either a person in costume or an effigy ) rides through the city on his carriage . the second is held on the first sunday of the festival and the participants are mainly children . the third and largest takes place on the last day of carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town 's longest avenue . the latter two parades are open to anyone who wishes to participate .
beyond this , byu also runs a very large study abroad program , with satellite centers in london , jerusalem , and paris , as well as more than 20 other sites . nearly 2,000 students take advantage of these programs yearly . in 2001 , the institute of international education ranked byu as the number one university in the u.s. to offer students study abroad opportunities . the byu jerusalem center , which was closed in 2000 due to student security concerns related to the second intifada and , more recently , the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict , was reopened to students in the winter 2007 semester .
gautama was now determined to complete his spiritual quest . at the age of 35 , he famously sat in meditation under a ficus religiosa tree now called the bodhi tree in the town of bodh gaya and vowed not to rise before achieving enlightenment . after many days , he finally destroyed the fetters of his mind , thereby liberating himself from the cycle of suffering and rebirth , and arose as a fully enlightened being ( skt . samyaksaṃbuddha ) . soon thereafter , he attracted a band of followers and instituted a monastic order . now , as the buddha , he spent the rest of his life teaching the path of awakening he had discovered , traveling throughout the northeastern part of the indian subcontinent , and died at the age of 80 ( 483 bce ) in kushinagar , india . the south branch of the original fig tree available only in anuradhapura sri lanka is known as jaya sri maha bodhi .
as edward was unmarried and had no children , albert was the heir presumptive to the throne . less than a year later , on 11 december 1936 , edward viii abdicated in order to marry his mistress , wallis simpson , who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second . edward had been advised by british prime minister stanley baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands . edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans . thus albert became king , a position he was reluctant to accept . the day before the abdication , he went to london to see his mother , queen mary . he wrote in his diary , " when i told her what had happened , i broke down and sobbed like a child . "
temporal measurement , chronometry , takes two distinct period forms : the calendar , a mathematical tool for organizing intervals of time , and the clock , a physical mechanism that counts the passage of time . in day-to-day life , the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day . increasingly , personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously . the number ( as on a clock dial or calendar ) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch—a central reference point .
