popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method , in favour of empirical falsification : a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven , but it can be falsified , meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments . he used the black swan fallacy to discuss falsification . if the outcome of an experiment contradicts the theory , one should refrain from ad hoc manoeuvres that evade the contradiction merely by making it less falsifiable . popper is also known for his opposition to the classical justificationist account of knowledge , which he replaced with critical rationalism , " the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy . "
in april 1979 , young students protested against bokassa 's decree that all school attendees would need to buy uniforms from a company owned by one of his wives . the government violently suppressed the protests , killing 100 children and teenagers . bokassa himself may have been personally involved in some of the killings . in september 1979 , france overthrew bokassa and " restored " dacko to power ( subsequently restoring the name of the country to the central african republic ) . dacko , in turn , was again overthrown in a coup by general andré kolingba on 1 september 1981 .
many flags of the islamic world are green , as the color is considered sacred in islam ( see below ) . the flag of hamas , as well as the flag of iran , is green , symbolizing their islamist ideology . the 1977 flag of libya consisted of a simple green field with no other characteristics . it was the only national flag in the world with just one color and no design , insignia , or other details . some countries used green in their flags to represent their country 's lush vegetation , as in the flag of jamaica , and hope in the future , as in the flags of portugal and nigeria . the green cedar of lebanon tree on the flag of lebanon officially represents steadiness and tolerance .
another great undertaking by constantine monomachos was the restoration of the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem between 1042 and 1048 . nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the russian abbot daniel , who visited jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description : " lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling , over the tribune . the altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of christ . in the main altar one can see the mosaic of the exhaltation of adam . in the apse the ascension of christ . the annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar . "
the final stage of database design is to make the decisions that affect performance , scalability , recovery , security , and the like . this is often called physical database design . a key goal during this stage is data independence , meaning that the decisions made for performance optimization purposes should be invisible to end-users and applications . physical design is driven mainly by performance requirements , and requires a good knowledge of the expected workload and access patterns , and a deep understanding of the features offered by the chosen dbms .
in general , usb cables have only plugs on their ends , while hosts and devices have only receptacles . hosts almost universally have type-a receptacles , while devices have one or another type-b variety . type-a plugs mate only with type-a receptacles , and the same applies to their type-b counterparts ; they are deliberately physically incompatible . however , an extension to the usb standard specification called usb on-the-go ( otg ) allows a single port to act as either a host or a device , which is selectable by the end of the cable that plugs into the receptacle on the otg-enabled unit . even after the cable is hooked up and the units are communicating , the two units may " swap " ends under program control . this capability is meant for units such as pdas in which the usb link might connect to a pc 's host port as a device in one instance , yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance .
lancashire had a lively culture of choral and classical music , with very large numbers of local church choirs from the 17th century , leading to the foundation of local choral societies from the mid-18th century , often particularly focused on performances of the music of handel and his contemporaries . it also played a major part in the development of brass bands which emerged in the county , particularly in the textile and coalfield areas , in the 19th century . the first open competition for brass bands was held at manchester in 1853 , and continued annually until the 1980s . the vibrant brass band culture of the area made an important contribution to the foundation and staffing of the hallé orchestra from 1857 , the oldest extant professional orchestra in the united kingdom . the same local musical tradition produced eminent figures such as sir william walton ( 1902–88 ) , son of an oldham choirmaster and music teacher , sir thomas beecham ( 1879–1961 ) , born in st. helens , who began his career by conducting local orchestras and alan rawsthorne ( 1905–71 ) born in haslingden . the conductor david atherton , co-founder of the london sinfonietta , was born in blackpool in 1944 . lancashire also produced more populist figures , such as early musical theatre composer leslie stuart ( 1863–1928 ) , born in southport , who began his musical career as organist of salford cathedral .
the state has the 12th-largest state economy in mexico , accounting for 2.7 % of the country ’ s gdp . chihuahua has the fifth highest manufacturing gdp in mexico and ranks second for the most factories funded by foreign investment in the country . as of 2011 [ update ] , the state had an estimated 396 billion pesos ( 31.1 billion dollars ) of annual gdp . according to official federal statistical studies , the service sector accounted for the largest portion of the state economy at 59.28 % ; the manufacturing and industrial sector is estimated to account for 34.36 % of the state 's gdp , with the agricultural sector accounting for 6.36 % of the state 's gdp . manufacturing sector was the principal foreign investment in the state followed by the mining sector . in 2011 , the state received approximately 884 million dollars in remittances from the united states , which was 4.5 % of all remittances from the united states to mexico .
the first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s ; in the 1930s approach lighting came into use . these indicated the proper direction and angle of descent . the colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) . in the 1940s , the slope-line approach system was introduced . this consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft 's position on the glideslope . additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction .
the majority of paris ' salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs , concentrated in the north-western 8th , 16th and 17th arrondissements . paris ' financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district . paris ' department store district in the 1st , 6th , 8th and 9th arrondissements employ 10 percent of mostly female paris workers , with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade . fourteen percent of parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals . nineteen percent of paris employees work for the state in either in administration or education . the majority of paris ' healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th , 14th , 18th , 19th and 20th arrondissements . outside paris , the western hauts-de-seine department la défense district specialising in finance , insurance and scientific research district , employs 144,600 , and the north-eastern seine-saint-denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios .
several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist . intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains . for example , an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome . acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal dna . antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to , and may have been transferred to , antibacterial-resistant strains . the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by horizontal genetic exchange . for instance , antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes . plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials . cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound .
victoria was pleased when gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated . she thought his government was " the worst i have ever had " , and blamed him for the death of general gordon at khartoum . gladstone was replaced by lord salisbury . salisbury 's government only lasted a few months , however , and victoria was forced to recall gladstone , whom she referred to as a " half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man " . gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting ireland home rule , but to victoria 's glee it was defeated . in the ensuing election , gladstone 's party lost to salisbury 's and the government switched hands again .
in the greater metropolitan area , 13 % of the population live below the poverty line . according to a 2012 report submitted by ghmc to the world bank , hyderabad has 1,476 slums with a total population of 1.7 million , of whom 66 % live in 985 slums in the " core " of the city ( the part that formed hyderabad before the april 2007 expansion ) and the remaining 34 % live in 491 suburban tenements . about 22 % of the slum-dwelling households had migrated from different parts of india in the last decade of the 20th century , and 63 % claimed to have lived in the slums for more than 10 years . :55 overall literacy in the slums is 60–80 % and female literacy is 52–73 % . a third of the slums have basic service connections , and the remainder depend on general public services provided by the government . there are 405 government schools , 267 government aided schools , 175 private schools and 528 community halls in the slum areas . :70 according to a 2008 survey by the centre for good governance , 87.6 % of the slum-dwelling households are nuclear families , 18 % are very poor , with an income up to ₹20000 ( us $ 300 ) per annum , 73 % live below the poverty line ( a standard poverty line recognised by the andhra pradesh government is ₹24000 ( us $ 360 ) per annum ) , 27 % of the chief wage earners ( cwe ) are casual labour and 38 % of the cwe are illiterate . about 3.72 % of the slum children aged 5–14 do not go to school and 3.17 % work as child labour , of whom 64 % are boys and 36 % are girls . the largest employers of child labour are street shops and construction sites . among the working children , 35 % are engaged in hazardous jobs . :59
the band , now revitalised by the response to live aid – a " shot in the arm " roger taylor called it , — and the ensuing increase in record sales , ended 1985 by releasing the single " one vision " , which was the third time after " stone cold crazy " and " under pressure ( with david bowie ) " that all four bandmembers received a writing credit for the one song . also , a limited-edition boxed set containing all queen albums to date was released under the title of the complete works . the package included previously unreleased material , most notably queen 's non-album single of christmas 1984 , titled " thank god it 's christmas " .
this office was first held by gabriel nicolas de la reynie , who had 44 commissaires de police ( police commissioners ) under his authority . in 1709 , these commissioners were assisted by inspecteurs de police ( police inspectors ) . the city of paris was divided into 16 districts policed by the commissaires , each assigned to a particular district and assisted by a growing bureaucracy . the scheme of the paris police force was extended to the rest of france by a royal edict of october 1699 , resulting in the creation of lieutenants general of police in all large french cities and towns .
in 1991 a mummy of a neolithic body , known as ötzi the iceman , was discovered by hikers on the similaun glacier . his clothing and gear indicate that he lived in an alpine farming community , while the location and manner of his death - an arrowhead was discovered in his shoulder - suggests he was travelling from one place to another . analysis of the mitochondrial dna of ötzi , has shown that he belongs to the k1 subclade which can not be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade . the new subclade has provisionally been named k1ö for ötzi .
victoria visited mainland europe regularly for holidays . in 1889 , during a stay in biarritz , she became the first reigning monarch from britain to set foot in spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit . by april 1900 , the boer war was so unpopular in mainland europe that her annual trip to france seemed inadvisable . instead , the queen went to ireland for the first time since 1861 , in part to acknowledge the contribution of irish regiments to the south african war . in july , her second son alfred ( " affie " ) died ; " oh , god ! my poor darling affie gone too " , she wrote in her journal . " it is a horrible year , nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another . "
philip ii of spain decreed the change from the julian to the gregorian calendar , which affected much of roman catholic europe , as philip was at the time ruler over spain and portugal as well as much of italy . in these territories , as well as in the polish–lithuanian commonwealth ( ruled by anna jagiellon ) and in the papal states , the new calendar was implemented on the date specified by the bull , with julian thursday , 4 october 1582 , being followed by gregorian friday , 15 october 1582 . the spanish and portuguese colonies followed somewhat later de facto because of delay in communication .
only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the early middle ages . the abbey of saint-martial in limoges , originally an important place of pilgrimage , was totally demolished during the french revolution except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s . a mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century . it somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble , probably taken from antique pavements . this could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the basilica of saint-quentin in picardy , where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors . the mosaics in the cathedral of saint-jean at lyon have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors . more fragments were found on the site of saint-croix at poitiers which might be from the 6th or 9th century .
viviparous mammals are in the subclass theria ; those living today are in the marsupial and placental infraclasses . a marsupial has a short gestation period , typically shorter than its estrous cycle , and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development ; in many species , this takes place within a pouch-like sac , the marsupium , located in the front of the mother 's abdomen . this is the plesyomorphic condition among viviparous mammals ; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy . even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way .
some viruses store their entire genomes in the form of rna , and contain no dna at all . because they use rna to store genes , their cellular hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription . on the other hand , rna retroviruses , such as hiv , require the reverse transcription of their genome from rna into dna before their proteins can be synthesized . rna-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals .
louis xvi translated the reflections " from end to end " into french . fellow whig mps richard sheridan and charles james fox , disagreed with burke and split with him . fox thought the reflections to be " in very bad taste " and " favouring tory principles " . other whigs such as the duke of portland and earl fitzwilliam privately agreed with burke , but did not wish for a public breach with their whig colleagues . burke wrote on 29 november 1790 : " i have received from the duke of portland , lord fitzwilliam , the duke of devonshire , lord john cavendish , montagu ( frederick montagu mp ) , and a long et cetera of the old stamina of the whiggs a most full approbation of the principles of that work and a kind indulgence to the execution " . the duke of portland said in 1791 that when anyone criticised the reflections to him , he informed them that he had recommended the book to his sons as containing the true whig creed .
in addition to these popular examples of house , there has also been a reunification of contemporary house and its roots . many hip hop and r & b artists also turn to house music to add a mass appeal to the music they produce .
replicated cds are mass-produced initially using a hydraulic press . small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press . a screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity . the mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface . the plastic is allowed to cool and harden . once opened , the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm , and a 15 mm diameter center hole ( called a stacking ring ) is created . the time it takes to " stamp " one cd is usually two to three seconds .
afscs range from officer specialties such as pilot , combat systems officer , missile launch officer , intelligence officer , aircraft maintenance officer , judge advocate general ( jag ) , medical doctor , nurse or other fields , to various enlisted specialties . the latter range from flight combat operations such as a gunner , to working in a dining facility to ensure that members are properly fed . there are additional occupational fields such as computer specialties , mechanic specialties , enlisted aircrew , communication systems , cyberspace operations , avionics technicians , medical specialties , civil engineering , public affairs , hospitality , law , drug counseling , mail operations , security forces , and search and rescue specialties .
the staten island ferry is the world 's busiest ferry route , carrying approximately 20 million passengers on the 5.2-mile ( 8.4 km ) route between staten island and lower manhattan and running 24 hours a day . other ferry systems shuttle commuters between manhattan and other locales within the city and the metropolitan area .
the simplest type of mp3 file uses one bit rate for the entire file : this is known as constant bit rate ( cbr ) encoding . using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and faster . however , it is also possible to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file . these are known as variable bit rate ( vbr ) files . the idea behind this is that , in any piece of audio , some parts will be much easier to compress , such as silence or music containing only a few instruments , while others will be more difficult to compress . so , the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts . with some encoders , it is possible to specify a given quality , and the encoder will vary the bit rate accordingly . users who know a particular " quality setting " that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music , and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate .
horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related . horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes . also , eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes .
new york city traces its roots to its 1624 founding as a trading post by colonists of the dutch republic and was named new amsterdam in 1626 . the city and its surroundings came under english control in 1664 . new york served as the capital of the united states from 1785 until 1790 . it has been the country 's largest city since 1790 . the statue of liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the americas by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and is a globally recognized symbol of the united states and its democracy .
the platyzoa include the phylum platyhelminthes , the flatworms . these were originally considered some of the most primitive bilateria , but it now appears they developed from more complex ancestors . a number of parasites are included in this group , such as the flukes and tapeworms . flatworms are acoelomates , lacking a body cavity , as are their closest relatives , the microscopic gastrotricha . the other platyzoan phyla are mostly microscopic and pseudocoelomate . the most prominent are the rotifera or rotifers , which are common in aqueous environments . they also include the acanthocephala or spiny-headed worms , the gnathostomulida , micrognathozoa , and possibly the cycliophora . these groups share the presence of complex jaws , from which they are called the gnathifera .
the relieved british began to assess the impact of the blitz in august 1941 , and the raf air staff used the german experience to improve bomber command 's offensives . they concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries because they had a greater impact on production than high explosives . they also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices , utilities and transport . they believed the luftwaffe had failed in precision attack , and concluded the german example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over germany .
building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs ( shelter , security , worship , etc . ) and means ( available building materials and attendant skills ) . as human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices , building became a craft , and " architecture " is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft .
glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation . the area in which a glacier forms is called a cirque ( corrie or cwm ) - a typically armchair-shaped geological feature ( such as a depression between mountains enclosed by arêtes ) - which collects and compresses through gravity the snow which falls into it . this snow collects and is compacted by the weight of the snow falling above it forming névé . further crushing of the individual snowflakes and squeezing the air from the snow turns it into 'glacial ice ' . this glacial ice will fill the cirque until it 'overflows ' through a geological weakness or vacancy , such as the gap between two mountains . when the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick , it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope , gravity and pressure . on steeper slopes , this can occur with as little as 15 m ( 50 ft ) of snow-ice .
punjab during mahabharata times was known as panchanada . punjab was part of the indus valley civilization , more than 4000 years ago . the main site in punjab was the city of harrapa . the indus valley civilization spanned much of what is today pakistan and eventually evolved into the indo-aryan civilisation . the vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the indus river . this civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in south asia and afghanistan . although the archaeological site at harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the lahore-multan railroad used brick from the harappa ruins for track ballast , an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found . punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the gandhara mahajanapadas , achaemenids , macedonians , mauryas , kushans , guptas , and hindu shahi . it also comprised the gujar empire for a period of time , otherwise known as the gurjara-pratihara empire . agriculture flourished and trading cities ( such as multan and lahore ) grew in wealth .
one of the characteristics of byu most often pointed out is its reputation for emphasizing a " marriage culture " . members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints highly value marriage and family , especially marriage within the faith . approximately 51 percent of the graduates in byu 's class of 2005 were married . this is compared to a national marriage average among college graduates of 11 percent . byu students on average marry at the age of 22 , according to a 2005 study , while the national average age is 25 years for men and 27 years for women .
the nazi regime under adolf hitler came to power in 1933 , and along with mussolini 's italy sought to gain control of the continent by the second world war . following the allied victory in the second world war , europe was divided by the iron curtain . the countries in southeastern europe were dominated by the soviet union and became communist states . the major non-communist southern european countries joined a us-led military alliance ( nato ) and formed the european economic community amongst themselves . the countries in the soviet sphere of influence joined the military alliance known as the warsaw pact and the economic bloc called comecon . yugoslavia was neutal .

in 1185 john made his first visit to ireland , accompanied by 300 knights and a team of administrators . henry had tried to have john officially proclaimed king of ireland , but pope lucius iii would not agree . john 's first period of rule in ireland was not a success . ireland had only recently been conquered by anglo-norman forces , and tensions were still rife between henry ii , the new settlers and the existing inhabitants . john infamously offended the local irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards , failed to make allies amongst the anglo-norman settlers , began to lose ground militarily against the irish and finally returned to england later in the year , blaming the viceroy , hugh de lacy , for the fiasco .
turkey also has a long history of poor relations with armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the armenian genocide . turkey was one of the first countries to recognize the republic of armenia ( the 3rd republic ) after its independence from the ussr in 1991 . despite this , for most of the 20th century and early 21st century , relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries due to turkey 's refusal to establish them for numerous reasons . during the nagorno-karabakh war and citing it as the reason , turkey illegally closed its land border with armenia in 1993 . it has not lifted its blockade despite pressure from the powerful turkish business lobby interested in armenian markets .
to finance state government operations , alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies . this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states . it is one of five states with no state sales tax , one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax , and one of the two states that has neither . the department of revenue tax division reports regularly on the state 's revenue sources . the department also issues an annual summary of its operations , including new state laws that directly affect the tax division .
industrialization is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one . it is a subdivision of a more general modernization process , where social change and economic development are closely related with technological innovation , particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production . it is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing . industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change , where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature .
having initially announced a new album entitled so help me god slated for a 2014 release , in march 2015 west announced that the album would instead be tentatively called swish . later that month , west was awarded an honorary doctorate by the school of the art institute of chicago for his contributions to music , fashion , and popular culture , officially making him an honorary dfa . the next month , west headlined at the glastonbury festival in the uk , despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance . at one point , he told the audience : " you are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet . " media outlets , including social media sites such as twitter , were sharply divided on his performance . nme stated , " the decision to book west for the slot has proved controversial since its announcement , and the show itself appeared to polarise both glastonbury goers and those who tuned in to watch on their tvs . " the publication added that " he 's letting his music speak for and prove itself . " the guardian said that " his set has a potent ferocity – but there are gaps and stutters , and he cuts a strangely lone figure in front of the vast crowd . "
eisenhower 's stint as the president of columbia university was punctuated by his activity within the council on foreign relations , a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the marshall plan , and the american assembly , eisenhower 's " vision of a great cultural center where business , professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature " . his biographer blanche wiesen cook suggested that this period served as " the political education of general eisenhower " , since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational , administrative , and financial demands for the university . through his involvement in the council on foreign relations , he also gained exposure to economic analysis , which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy . " whatever general eisenhower knows about economics , he has learned at the study group meetings , " one aid to europe member claimed .
from january 18–20 , 2010 a national conference on tibet and areas inhabited by tibetans in sichuan , yunnan , gansu and qinghai was held in china and a substantial plan to improve development of the areas was announced . the conference was attended by general secretary hu jintao , wu bangguo , wen jiabao , jia qinglin , li changchun , xi jinping , li keqiang , he guoqiang and zhou yongkang , all members of cpc politburo standing committee signaling the commitment of senior chinese leaders to development of tibet and ethnic tibetan areas . the plan calls for improvement of rural tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural tibetan children . china has invested 310 billion yuan ( about 45.6 billion u.s. dollars ) in tibet since 2001 . " tibet 's gdp was expected to reach 43.7 billion yuan in 2009 , up 170 percent from that in 2000 and posting an annual growth of 12.3 percent over the past nine years . "
sarvastivada teachings—which were criticized by nāgārjuna—were reformulated by scholars such as vasubandhu and asanga and were adapted into the yogacara school . while the mādhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate , some exponents of yogacara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real ( a doctrine known as cittamatra ) . not all yogacarins asserted that mind was truly existent ; vasubandhu and asanga in particular did not . [ web 11 ] these two schools of thought , in opposition or synthesis , form the basis of subsequent mahayana metaphysics in the indo-tibetan tradition .
the total number of greeks living outside greece and cyprus today is a contentious issue . where census figures are available , they show around 3 million greeks outside greece and cyprus . estimates provided by the sae - world council of hellenes abroad put the figure at around 7 million worldwide . according to george prevelakis of sorbonne university , the number is closer to just below 5 million . integration , intermarriage , and loss of the greek language influence the self-identification of the omogeneia . important centres of the new greek diaspora today are london , new york , melbourne and toronto . in 2010 , the hellenic parliament introduced a law that enables diaspora greeks in greece to vote in the elections of the greek state . this law was later repealed in early 2014 .
verdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper , brass or bronze , slightly warmed , into a vat of fermenting wine , leaving it there for several weeks , and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal . the process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by pliny . it was used by the romans in the murals of pompeii , and in celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century ad . it produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate , but it had drawbacks ; it was unstable , it could not resist dampness , it did not mix well with other colors , it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact. , and it was toxic . leonardo da vinci , in his treatise on painting , warned artists not to use it . it was widely used in miniature paintings in europe and persia in the 16th and 17th centuries . its use largely ended in the late 19th century , when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green . viridian , also called chrome green , is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate , was patented in 1859 . it became popular with painters , since , unlike other synthetic greens , it was stable and not toxic . vincent van gogh used it , along with prussian blue , to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting cafe terrace at night .
after the marzpanate period ( 428–636 ) , armenia emerged as the emirate of armenia , an autonomous principality within the arabic empire , reuniting armenian lands previously taken by the byzantine empire as well . the principality was ruled by the prince of armenia , and recognized by the caliph and the byzantine emperor . it was part of the administrative division/emirate arminiya created by the arabs , which also included parts of georgia and caucasian albania , and had its center in the armenian city , dvin . the principality of armenia lasted until 884 , when it regained its independence from the weakened arab empire under king ashot i bagratuni .
seattle 's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies , and " new economy " internet and technology companies , service , design and clean technology companies . the city 's gross metropolitan product was $ 231 billion in 2010 , making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the united states . the port of seattle , which also operates seattle–tacoma international airport , is a major gateway for trade with asia and cruises to alaska , and is the 8th largest port in the united states in terms of container capacity . though it was affected by the great recession , seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy , and remains a hotbed for start-up businesses , especially in green building and clean technologies : it was ranked as america 's no . 1 " smarter city " based on its government policies and green economy . in february 2010 , the city government committed seattle to becoming north america 's first " climate neutral " city , with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 .
in june , 1998 sammy sosa exploded into the pursuit of roger maris ' home run record . sosa had 13 home runs entering the month , representing less than half of mark mcgwire 's total . sosa had his first of four multi-home run games that month on june 1 , and went on to break rudy york 's record with 20 home runs in the month , a record that still stands . by the end of his historic month , the outfielder 's 33 home runs tied him with ken griffey , jr. and left him only four behind mcgwire 's 37 . sosa finished with 66 and won the nl mvp award .
the tuvaluan language and english are the national languages of tuvalu . tuvaluan is of the ellicean group of polynesian languages , distantly related to all other polynesian languages such as hawaiian , māori , tahitian , samoan and tongan . it is most closely related to the languages spoken on the polynesian outliers in micronesia and northern and central melanesia . the language has borrowed from the samoan language , as a consequence of christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly samoan .
during the 19th century , it was not infrequent for the foreign office to approach the times and ask for continental intelligence , which was often superior to that conveyed by official sources . [ citation needed ]
the migration of birds also aids the movement of other species , including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice , which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health . due to the global spread of avian influenza , bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission , but it has been found not to present a special risk ; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat . some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects , such as the west nile virus may however be spread by migrating birds . birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton .
a computer 's memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read . each cell has a numbered " address " and can store a single number . the computer can be instructed to " put the number 123 into the cell numbered 1357 " or to " add the number that is in cell 1357 to the number that is in cell 2468 and put the answer into cell 1595 . " the information stored in memory may represent practically anything . letters , numbers , even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease . since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information , it is the software 's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers .
tcm 's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized ( with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color ) , depending upon the original content of movies , particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the motion picture association of america 's ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the motion picture production code . because of this , tcm is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity , sexual content , violence and/or strong profanity ; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program ( most programs on tcm , especially films , are rated for content using the tv parental guidelines , in lieu of the mpaa 's rating system ) .
faced with growing separatism , gorbachev sought to restructure the soviet union into a less centralized state . on august 20 , 1991 , the russian sfsr was scheduled to sign a new union treaty that would have converted the soviet union into a federation of independent republics with a common president , foreign policy and military . it was strongly supported by the central asian republics , which needed the economic advantages of a common market to prosper . however , it would have meant some degree of continued communist party control over economic and social life .
greece 's foreign policy is conducted through the ministry for foreign affairs and its head , the minister for foreign affairs . the current minister is nikos kotzias . according to the official website , the main aims of the ministry for foreign affairs are to represent greece before other states and international organizations ; safeguarding the interests of the greek state and of its citizens abroad ; the promotion of greek culture ; the fostering of closer relations with the greek diaspora ; and the promotion of international cooperation . additionally , due to its political and geographical proximity to europe , asia , the middle east and africa , greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance and is considered to be a middle power and has developed a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the balkans , the mediterranean , and the middle east .
feathers are a feature characteristic of birds ( though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds ) . they facilitate flight , provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation , and are used in display , camouflage , and signaling . there are several types of feathers , each serving its own set of purposes . feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae . the distribution pattern of these feather tracts ( pterylosis ) is used in taxonomy and systematics . the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body , called plumage , may vary within species by age , social status , and sex .
the bronx underwent rapid urban growth after world war i. extensions of the new york city subway contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the bronx , resulting in a major boom in residential construction . among these groups , many irish americans , italian americans and especially jewish americans settled here . in addition , french , german , polish and other immigrants moved into the borough . the jewish population also increased notably during this time . in 1937 , according to jewish organizations , 592,185 jews lived in the bronx ( 43.9 % of the borough 's population ) , while only 54,000 jews lived in the borough in 2011 . many synagogues still stand in the bronx , but most have been converted to other uses .
the optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image 's characteristics . for best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio , lines , and frame rate should match those of the source .
the word " insect " comes from the latin word insectum , meaning " with a notched or divided body " , or literally " cut into " , from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare , " to cut into , to cut up " , from in- " into " and secare " to cut " ; because insects appear " cut into " three sections . pliny the elder introduced the latin designation as a loan-translation of the greek word ἔντομος ( éntomos ) or " insect " ( as in entomology ) , which was aristotle 's term for this class of life , also in reference to their " notched " bodies . " insect " first appears documented in english in 1601 in holland 's translation of pliny . translations of aristotle 's term also form the usual word for " insect " in welsh ( trychfil , from trychu " to cut " and mil , " animal " ) , serbo-croatian ( zareznik , from rezati , " to cut " ) , russian ( насекомое nasekomoje , from seč'/-sekat ' , " to cut " ) , etc .
tourist hotspots in portugal are lisbon , algarve , madeira , porto and the city of coimbra , also , between 4-5 million religious pilgrims visit fátima each year , where apparitions of the blessed virgin mary to three shepherd children reportedly took place in 1917 . the sanctuary of fátima is one of the largest roman catholic shrines in the world . the portuguese government continues to promote and develop new tourist destinations , such as the douro valley , the island of porto santo , and alentejo . lisbon is the 16th european city which attracts the most tourists ( with seven million tourists occupying the city 's hotels in 2006 , a number that grew 11.8 % compared to previous year ) . lisbon in recent years surpassed the algarve as the leading tourist region in portugal . porto and northern portugal , especially the urban areas north of douro river valley , was the tourist destination which grew most ( 11.9 % ) in 2006 , surpassing madeira ( in 2010 ) , as the third most visited destination .

although the israelites were divided into twelve tribes , the jews ( being one offshoot of the israelites , another being the samaritans ) are traditionally said to descend mostly from the israelite tribes of judah ( from where the jews derive their ethnonym ) and benjamin , and partially from the tribe of levi , who had together formed the ancient kingdom of judah , and the remnants of the northern kingdom of israel who migrated to the kingdom of judah and assimilated after the 720s bce , when the kingdom of israel was conquered by the neo-assyrian empire .
from the start of the 20th century through the 1970s , the american tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in san diego , " the tuna capital of the world " . san diego 's first tuna cannery was founded in 1911 , and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people . a large fishing fleet supported the canneries , mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from japan , and later from the portuguese azores and italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like little italy and point loma . due to rising costs and foreign competition , the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s .
greece is classified as an advanced , high-income economy , and was a founding member of the organisation for economic co-operation and development ( oecd ) and of the organization of the black sea economic cooperation ( bsec ) . the country joined what is now the european union in 1981 . in 2001 greece adopted the euro as its currency , replacing the greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachmae per euro . greece is a member of the international monetary fund and of the world trade organization , and ranked 34th on ernst & young 's globalization index 2011 .
h 2 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories , often as a by-product of other reactions ; in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates ; and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions .
on july 6 , john kerry selected john edwards as his running mate , shortly before the 2004 democratic national convention in boston , held later that month . days before kerry announced edwards as his running mate , kerry gave a short list of three candidates : sen john edwards , rep dick gephardt , and gov tom vilsack . heading into the convention , the kerry/edwards ticket unveiled their new slogan—a promise to make america " stronger at home and more respected in the world . " kerry made his vietnam war experience the prominent theme of the convention . in accepting the nomination , he began his speech with , " i 'm john kerry and i 'm reporting for duty . " he later delivered what may have been the speech 's most memorable line when he said , " the future does n't belong to fear , it belongs to freedom " , a quote that later appeared in a kerry/edwards television advertisement .
in 1808 bavarian educational commissioner friedrich immanuel niethammer coined the term humanismus to describe the new classical curriculum he planned to offer in german secondary schools , and by 1836 the word " humanism " had been absorbed into the english language in this sense . the coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856 , when german historian and philologist georg voigt used humanism to describe renaissance humanism , the movement that flourished in the italian renaissance to revive classical learning , a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations , especially italy .
when a second round of elections were finally held in 1993 , again with the help of the international community coordinated by gibafor , ange-félix patassé won in the second round of voting with 53 % of the vote while goumba won 45.6 % . patassé 's party , the mouvement pour la libération du peuple centrafricain ( mlpc ) or movement for the liberation of the central african people , gained a simple but not an absolute majority of seats in parliament , which meant patassé 's party required coalition partners .

the premier league has the highest revenue of any football league in the world , with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10 . in 2013–14 , due to improved television revenues and cost controls , the premier league had net profits in excess of £78 million , exceeding all other football leagues . in 2010 the premier league was awarded the queen 's award for enterprise in the international trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to english football and the united kingdom 's broadcasting industry .
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms . cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them .
the exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the cppcg legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists , for example m. hassan kakar in his book the soviet invasion and the afghan response , 1979–1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted , and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes chalk and jonassohn : " genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group , as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator . " while there are various definitions of the term , adam jones states that the majority of genocide scholars consider that " intent to destroy " is a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide , and that there is growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion .
the café procope was established in paris in 1686 ; by the 1720s there were around 400 cafés in the city . the café procope in particular became a center of enlightenment , welcoming such celebrities as voltaire and rousseau . the café procope was where diderot and d'alembert decided to create the encyclopédie . the cafés were one of the various " nerve centers " for bruits publics , public noise or rumour . these bruits were allegedly a much better source of information than were the actual newspapers available at the time .
one by one , additional large hotels were constructed along the boardwalk , including the brighton , chelsea , shelburne , ambassador , ritz carlton , mayflower , madison house , and the breakers . the quaker-owned chalfonte house , opened in 1868 , and haddon house , opened in 1869 , flanked north carolina avenue at the beach end . their original wood-frame structures would be enlarged , and even moved closer to the beach , over the years . the modern chalfonte hotel , eight stories tall , opened in 1904 . the modern haddon hall was built in stages and was completed in 1929 , at eleven stories . by this time , they were under the same ownership and merged into the chalfonte-haddon hall hotel , becoming the city 's largest hotel with nearly 1,000 rooms . by 1930 , the claridge , the city 's last large hotel before the casinos , opened its doors . the 400-room claridge was built by a partnership that included renowned philadelphia contractor john mcshain . at 24 stories , it would become known as the " skyscraper by the sea . " the city became known as the " the world 's playground .
malaysia : the event was held in the capital city , kuala lumpur , on april 21 . the 16.5 km long-relay began from the historic independence square , passed in front of several city landmarks before coming to an end at the iconic petronas twin towers . among the landmarks the olympic flame passed next to were the parliament house , national mosque , kl tower and merdeka stadium . a team of 1000 personnel from the malaysian police special action squad guarded the event and escorted the torchbearers . the last time an olympic torch relay was held in malaysia was the 1964 tokyo edition .
the mid-1970s saw the introduction of dbx-encoded records , again for the audiophile niche market . these were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers , relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range ( dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed by a factor of two in db : quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain , via automatic gain control in the playback equipment ; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages ) . a similar and very short-lived scheme involved using the cbs-developed " cx " noise reduction encoding/decoding scheme .
chopin 's tombstone , featuring the muse of music , euterpe , weeping over a broken lyre , was designed and sculpted by clésinger . the expenses of the funeral and monument , amounting to 5,000 francs , were covered by jane stirling , who also paid for the return of the composer 's sister ludwika to warsaw . ludwika took chopin 's heart in an urn , preserved in alcohol , back to poland in 1850 . [ n 9 ] she also took a collection of two hundred letters from sand to chopin ; after 1851 these were returned to sand , who seems to have destroyed them .
according to this narrative , shortly after the birth of young prince gautama , an astrologer named asita visited the young prince 's father , suddhodana , and prophesied that siddhartha would either become a great king or renounce the material world to become a holy man , depending on whether he saw what life was like outside the palace walls .
in a channel transupport system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria . it is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the abc protein , membrane fusion protein ( mfp ) , and outer membrane protein ( omp ) [ specify ] . this secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20 - 900 kda ) . the molecules secreted vary in size from the small escherichia coli peptide colicin v , ( 10 kda ) to the pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein lapa of 900 kda .
architectural interest in cubism centered on the dissolution and reconstitution of three-dimensional form , using simple geometric shapes , juxtaposed without the illusions of classical perspective . diverse elements could be superimposed , made transparent or penetrate one another , while retaining their spatial relationships . cubism had become an influential factor in the development of modern architecture from 1912 ( la maison cubiste , by raymond duchamp-villon and andré mare ) onwards , developing in parallel with architects such as peter behrens and walter gropius , with the simplification of building design , the use of materials appropriate to industrial production , and the increased use of glass .
within buddhism , samsara is defined as the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death that arises from ordinary beings ' grasping and fixating on a self and experiences . specifically , samsara refers to the process of cycling through one rebirth after another within the six realms of existence , [ note 2 ] where each realm can be understood as physical realm or a psychological state characterized by a particular type of suffering . samsara arises out of avidya ( ignorance ) and is characterized by dukkha ( suffering , anxiety , dissatisfaction ) . in the buddhist view , liberation from samsara is possible by following the buddhist path .
in the kingdom of holland , the british launched the walcheren campaign to open up a second front in the war and to relieve the pressure on the austrians . the british army only landed at walcheren on 30 july , by which point the austrians had already been defeated . the walcheren campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed " walcheren fever . " over 4000 british troops were lost in a bungled campaign , and the rest withdrew in december 1809 . the main strategic result from the campaign became the delayed political settlement between the french and the austrians . emperor francis wanted to wait and see how the british performed in their theater before entering into negotiations with napoleon . once it became apparent that the british were going nowhere , the austrians agreed to peace talks .
in britain , william paley 's natural theology saw adaptation as evidence of beneficial " design " by the creator acting through natural laws . all naturalists in the two english universities ( oxford and cambridge ) were church of england clergymen , and science became a search for these laws . geologists adapted catastrophism to show repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment , initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood . some anatomists such as robert grant were influenced by lamarck and geoffroy , but most naturalists regarded their ideas of transmutation as a threat to divinely appointed social order .
the modern english word green comes from the middle english and anglo-saxon word grene , from the same germanic root as the words " grass " and " grow " . it is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime , growth and nature . by far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll , the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage . several minerals have a green color , including the emerald , which is colored green by its chromium content .
colloquially , the term university may be used to describe a phase in one 's life : " when i was at university ... " ( in the united states and ireland , college is often used instead : " when i was in college ... " ) . in australia , canada , new zealand , the united kingdom , nigeria , the netherlands , spain and the german-speaking countries university is often contracted to uni . in ghana , new zealand and in south africa it is sometimes called " varsity " ( although this has become uncommon in new zealand in recent years ) . " varsity " was also common usage in the uk in the 19th century . [ citation needed ] " varsity " is still in common usage in scotland .
a broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood . according to hogan & astone ( 1986 ) , this transition can include markers such as leaving school , starting a full-time job , leaving the home of origin , getting married , and becoming a parent for the first time . however , the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture . in some countries , such as the united states , adolescence can last nearly a decade , but in others , the transition—often in the form of a ceremony—can last for only a few days .
the west campus is located about one mile ( 1.6 km ) to the west of the danforth campus in clayton , missouri , and primarily consists of a four-story former department store building housing mostly administrative space . the west campus building was home to the clayton branch of the famous-barr department store until 1990 , when the university acquired the property and adjacent parking and began a series of renovations . today , the basement level houses the west campus library , the university archives , the modern graphic history library , and conference space . the ground level still remains a retail space . the upper floors house consolidated capital gifts , portions of alumni and development , and information systems offices from across the danforth and medical school campuses . there is also a music rehearsal room on the second floor . the west campus is also home to the center for the application of information technologies ( cait ) , which provides it training services .
at the glass transition temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion ; exceeding tg then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g . the joints and the vias . below tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass , above it gets significantly higher . as the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane , virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes . repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating , especially with thicker boards ; thick boards therefore require high tg matrix .
ptolemy 's family ruled egypt until the roman conquest of 30 bc . all the male rulers of the dynasty took the name ptolemy . ptolemaic queens , some of whom were the sisters of their husbands , were usually called cleopatra , arsinoe or berenice . the most famous member of the line was the last queen , cleopatra vii , known for her role in the roman political battles between julius caesar and pompey , and later between octavian and mark antony . her suicide at the conquest by rome marked the end of ptolemaic rule in egypt though hellenistic culture continued to thrive in egypt throughout the roman and byzantine periods until the muslim conquest .
for administrative purposes , the federal district is divided into 16 " delegaciones " or boroughs . while not fully equivalent to a municipality , the 16 boroughs have gained significant autonomy , and since 2000 their heads of government are elected directly by plurality ( they were previously appointed by the head of government of the federal district ) . given that mexico city is organized entirely as a federal district , most of the city services are provided or organized by the government of the federal district and not by the boroughs themselves , while in the constituent states these services would be provided by the municipalities . the 16 boroughs of the federal district with their 2010 populations are :
the territory now contained within bronx county was originally part of westchester county , one of the 12 original counties of the english province of new york . the present bronx county was contained in the town of westchester and parts of the towns of yonkers , eastchester , and pelham . in 1846 , a new town , west farms , was created by division of westchester ; in turn , in 1855 , the town of morrisania was created from west farms . in 1873 , the town of kingsbridge ( roughly corresponding to the modern bronx neighborhoods of kingsbridge , riverdale , and woodlawn ) was established within the former borders of yonkers .
in a slightly more complex form a sender and a receiver are linked reciprocally . this second attitude of communication , referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view , focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted . communication is viewed as a conduit ; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself . a particular instance of communication is called a speech act . the sender 's personal filters and the receiver 's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions , cultures , or gender ; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents . in the presence of " communication noise " on the transmission channel ( air , in this case ) , reception and decoding of content may be faulty , and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect . one problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook , and that these two code books are , at the very least , similar if not identical . although something like code books is implied by the model , they are nowhere represented in the model , which creates many conceptual difficulties .
critics labelled gaddafi " despotic , cruel , arrogant , vain and stupid " , with western governments and press presenting him as the " vicious dictator of an oppressed people " . during the reagan administration , the united states regarded him as " public enemy no . 1 " and reagan famously dubbed him the " mad dog of the middle east " . according to critics , the libyan people lived in a climate of fear under gaddafi 's administration , due to his government 's pervasive surveillance of civilians . gaddafi 's libya was typically described by western commentators as " a police state " . opponents were critical of libya 's human rights abuses ; according to human rights watch ( hrw ) and others , hundreds of arrested political opponents often failed to receive a fair trial , and were sometimes subjected to torture or extrajudicial execution , most notably in the abu salim prison , including an alleged massacre on 29 june 1996 in which hrw estimated that 1,270 prisoners were massacred . dissidents abroad or " stray dogs " were also publicly threatened with death and sometimes killed by government hit squads . his government 's treatment of non-arab libyans has also came in for criticism from human rights activists , with native berbers , italians , jews , refugees , and foreign workers all facing persecution in gaddafist libya . according to journalist annick cojean and psychologist seham sergewa , gaddafi and senior officials raped and imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards . gaddafi 's government was frequently criticized for not being democratic , with freedom house consistently giving libya under gaddafi the " not free " ranking for civil liberties and political rights .
in 1954 , eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in southeast asia and also in central america . he believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in vietnam , this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism , from laos through malaysia and indonesia ultimately to india . likewise , the fall of guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring mexico . that year the loss of north vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed european defence community ( edc ) were serious defeats , but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism , saying " long faces do n't win wars " . as he had threatened the french in their rejection of edc , he afterwards moved to restore west germany , as a full nato partner .
from 1946 to 1964 five departments of state did the work of the modern ministry of defence : the admiralty , the war office , the air ministry , the ministry of aviation , and an earlier form of the ministry of defence . these departments merged in 1964 ; the defence functions of the ministry of aviation supply merged into the ministry of defence in 1971 .
michael lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the judges ' save . the next week katie stevens and andrew garcia were eliminated . that week , adam lambert was invited back to be a mentor , the first idol alum to do so . idol gives back returned this season on april 21 , 2010 , and raised $ 45 million .
in tumbling , athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track . scoring is similar to trampolining . tumbling was originally contested as one of the events in men 's artistic gymnastics at the 1932 summer olympics , and in 1955 and 1959 at the pan american games . from 1974 to 1998 it was included as an event for both genders at the acrobatic gymnastics world championships . the event has also been contested since 1976 at the trampoline world championships . since the recognition of trampoline and acrobatic gymnastics as fig disciplines in 1999 , official tumbling competitions are only allowed as an event in trampoline gymnastics meets .
in 2004 , the cubs were a consensus pick by most media outlets to win the world series . the offseason acquisition of derek lee ( who was acquired in a trade with florida for hee-seop choi ) and the return of greg maddux only bolstered these expectation . despite a mid-season deal for nomar garciaparra , misfortune struck the cubs again . they led the wild card by 1.5 games over san francisco and houston on september 25 , and both of those teams lost that day , giving the cubs a chance at increasing the lead to a commanding 2.5 games with only eight games remaining in the season , but reliever latroy hawkins blew a save to the mets , and the cubs lost the game in extra innings , a defeat that seemingly deflated the team , as they proceeded to drop 6 of their last 8 games as the astros won the wild card .
the end for the laemmles came with a lavish version of show boat ( 1936 ) , a remake of its earlier 1929 part-talkie production , and produced as a high-quality , big-budget film rather than as a b-picture . the new film featured several stars from the broadway stage version , which began production in late 1935 , and unlike the 1929 film was based on the broadway musical rather than the novel . carl , jr. 's spending habits alarmed company stockholders . they would not allow production to start on show boat unless the laemmles obtained a loan . universal was forced to seek a $ 750,000 production loan from the standard capital corporation , pledging the laemmle family 's controlling interest in universal as collateral . it was the first time universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26-year history . the production went $ 300,000 over budget ; standard called in the loan , cash-strapped universal could not pay , standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on april 2 , 1936 .
appointments to the order of the british empire were discontinued in those commonwealth realms that established a national system of honours and awards such as the order of australia , the order of canada , and the new zealand order of merit . in many of these systems , the different levels of award and honour reflect the imperial system they replaced . canada , australia , and new zealand all have ( in increasing level of precedence ) members of , officers of , and companions to ( rather than commanders of ) their respective orders , with both australia and new zealand having knights and dames as their highest classes .
all states have a geographic scope of interests , actions , or projected power . this is a crucial factor in distinguishing a great power from a regional power ; by definition the scope of a regional power is restricted to its region . it has been suggested that a great power should be possessed of actual influence throughout the scope of the prevailing international system . arnold j. toynbee , for example , observes that " great power may be defined as a political force exerting an effect co-extensive with the widest range of the society in which it operates . the great powers of 1914 were 'world-powers ' because western society had recently become 'world-wide ' . "
robert n. bellah has in his writings that although the separation of church and state is grounded firmly in the constitution of the united states , this does not mean that there is no religious dimension in the political society of the united states . he used the term " civil religion " to describe the specific relation between politics and religion in the united states . his 1967 article analyzes the inaugural speech of john f. kennedy : " considering the separation of church and state , how is a president justified in using the word 'god ' at all ? the answer is that the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension . "
in some languages , such as english , aspiration is allophonic . stops are distinguished primarily by voicing , and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated , while voiced stops are usually unaspirated .
glass remained a luxury material , and the disasters that overtook late bronze age civilizations seem to have brought glass-making to a halt . indigenous development of glass technology in south asia may have begun in 1730 bce . in ancient china , though , glassmaking seems to have a late start , compared to ceramics and metal work . the term glass developed in the late roman empire . it was in the roman glassmaking center at trier , now in modern germany , that the late-latin term glesum originated , probably from a germanic word for a transparent , lustrous substance . glass objects have been recovered across the roman empire in domestic , industrial and funerary contexts .

the slowing sales growth has been attributed to the maturing pc market , which constituted 66 % of dell 's sales , and analysts suggested that dell needed to make inroads into non-pc businesses segments such as storage , services and servers . dell 's price advantage was tied to its ultra-lean manufacturing for desktop pcs , but this became less important as savings became harder to find inside the company 's supply chain , and as competitors such as hewlett-packard and acer made their pc manufacturing operations more efficient to match dell , weakening dell 's traditional price differentiation . throughout the entire pc industry , declines in prices along with commensurate increases in performance meant that dell had fewer opportunities to upsell to their customers ( a lucrative strategy of encouraging buyers to upgrade the processor or memory ) . as a result , the company was selling a greater proportion of inexpensive pcs than before , which eroded profit margins . the laptop segment had become the fastest-growing of the pc market , but dell produced low-cost notebooks in china like other pc manufacturers which eliminated dell 's manufacturing cost advantages , plus dell 's reliance on internet sales meant that it missed out on growing notebook sales in big box stores . cnet has suggested that dell was getting trapped in the increasing commoditization of high volume low margin computers , which prevented it from offering more exciting devices that consumers demanded .
a tile mosaic is a digital image made up of individual tiles , arranged in a non-overlapping fashion , e.g . to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor , by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles ( a typical size is 1 in × 1 in ( 25 mm × 25 mm ) , as for example , on the floor of the university of toronto pool , though sometimes larger tiles such as 2 in × 2 in ( 51 mm × 51 mm ) are used ) . these digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text , such as the depth of the pool in various places , but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme .
some experiments on very resinous longleaf pine specimens indicate an increase in strength , due to the resin which increases the strength when dry . such resin-saturated heartwood is called " fat lighter " . structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites ; however they are very flammable . stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug , split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires . stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut . spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby .
there are also christian movements which cross denominational lines and even branches , and can not be classified on the same level previously mentioned forms . evangelicalism is a prominent example . some of those movements are active exclusively within protestantism , some are christian-wide . transdenominational movements are sometimes capable of affecting parts of the roman catholic church , such as does it the charismatic movement , which aims to incorporate beliefs and practices similar to pentecostals into the various branches of christianity . neo-charismatic churches are sometimes regarded as a subgroup of the charismatic movement . nondenominational churches often adopt , or are akin to one of these movements .
the treaty was published in the united states for the first time by the st. louis post-dispatch on may 22 , 1946 , in britain by the manchester guardian . it was also part of an official state department publication , nazi–soviet relations 1939–1941 , edited by raymond j. sontag and james s. beddie in january 1948 . the decision to publish the key documents on german–soviet relations , including the treaty and protocol , had been taken already in spring 1947 . sontag and beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947 . in november 1947 , president truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the foreign ministers conference in london scheduled for december . since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an american point of view , the document edition was sent to press . the documents made headlines worldwide . state department officials counted it as a success : " the soviet government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war . "
the premier league sells its television rights on a collective basis . this is in contrast to some other european leagues , including la liga , in which each club sells its rights individually , leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs . the money is divided into three parts : half is divided equally between the clubs ; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position , the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club , and equal steps all the way down the table ; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television , with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this . the income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs .
another 44 million acres ( 18 million hectares ) are owned by 12 regional , and scores of local , native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ( ancsa ) of 1971 . regional native corporation doyon , limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications . provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations ' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect . effectively , the corporations hold title ( including subsurface title in many cases , a privilege denied to individual alaskans ) but can not sell the land . individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market , however .
political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and roman catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the roman catholic church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . however , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly christianity . the most outspoken critic of the church in france was françois marie arouet de voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . after voltaire , religion would never be the same again in france .
following the fall of wu and the turmoil of the wu hu uprising against the jin dynasty ( 265–420 ) , most of elite chinese families had collaborated with the non-chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north . some may have lost social privilege , and took refugee in areas south to yangtze river . some of the chinese refugees from north china might have resided in areas near hangzhou . for example , the clan of zhuge liang ( 181–234 ) , a chancellor of the state of shu han from central plain in north china during the three kingdoms period , gathered together at the suburb of hangzhou , forming an exclusive , closed village zhuge village ( zhege cun ) , consisting of villagers all with family name " zhuge " . the village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day , and only recently came to be known in public . it suggests that a small number of powerful , elite chinese refugees from the central plain might have taken refugee in south of the yangtze river . however , considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in zhejiang , most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south china beyond zhejiang , where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available , mainly north jiangsu , west fujian , jiangxi , hunan , anhui , and provinces where less cohesive , organized regional governments had been in place . metropolitan areas of sichuan was another hub for refugees , given that the state of shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the central plain and north china . some refugees from the north china might have found residence in south china depending on their social status and military power in the north . the rump jin state or the southern dynasties vied against some elite chinese from the central plain and south of the yangtze river .
magic was practiced widely , and these too , were a continuation from earlier times . throughout the hellenistic world , people would consult oracles , and use charms and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells . also developed in this era was the complex system of astrology , which sought to determine a person 's character and future in the movements of the sun , moon , and planets . astrology was widely associated with the cult of tyche ( luck , fortune ) , which grew in popularity during this period .
there is archaeological evidence that parts of the foundations of the old ferryboat inn in holywell may date to ad 460 , and there is evidence of ale being served as early as ad 560 .
others , such as rep. roger sherman of connecticut , believed the clause was unnecessary because the original constitution only gave congress stated powers , which did not include establishing a national religion . anti-federalists such as rep. thomas tucker of south carolina moved to strike the establishment clause completely because it could preempt the religious clauses in the state constitutions . however , the anti-federalists were unsuccessful in persuading the house of representatives to drop the clause from the first amendment .
christianity remains the dominant religion in the western world , where 70 % are christians . a 2011 pew research center survey found that 76.2 % of europeans , 73.3 % in oceania , and about 86.0 % in the americas ( 90 % in latin america and 77.4 % in north america ) described themselves as christians .
1 stobar carrier : admiral flota sovetskovo soyuza kuznetsov : 55,000 tonne admiral kuznetsov-class stobar aircraft carrier . launched in 1985 as tbilisi , renamed and operational from 1995 . without catapults she can launch and recover lightly fueled naval fighters for air defense or anti-ship missions but not heavy conventional bombing strikes . [ citation needed ] officially designated an aircraft carrying cruiser , she is unique in carrying a heavy cruiser 's complement of defensive weapons and large p-700 granit offensive missiles . the p-700 systems will be removed in the coming refit to enlarge her below decks aviation facilities as well as upgrading her defensive systems .
many hunter-gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning undesirable plants while encouraging desirable ones , some even going to the extent of slash-and-burn to create habitat for game animals . these activities are on an entirely different scale to those associated with agriculture , but they are nevertheless domestication on some level . today , almost all hunter-gatherers depend to some extent upon domesticated food sources either produced part-time or traded for products acquired in the wild .
in recognition of his senior position in the allied command , on december 20 , 1944 , he was promoted to general of the army , equivalent to the rank of field marshal in most european armies . in this and the previous high commands he held , eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy . although he had never seen action himself , he won the respect of front-line commanders . he interacted adeptly with allies such as winston churchill , field marshal bernard montgomery and general charles de gaulle . he had serious disagreements with churchill and montgomery over questions of strategy , but these rarely upset his relationships with them . he dealt with soviet marshal zhukov , his russian counterpart , and they became good friends .
scientific and technological research activities in portugal are mainly conducted within a network of r & d units belonging to public universities and state-managed autonomous research institutions like the ineti – instituto nacional de engenharia , tecnologia e inovação and the inrb – instituto nacional dos recursos biológicos . the funding and management of this research system is mainly conducted under the authority of the ministry of science , technology and higher education ( mctes ) itself and the mctes 's fundação para a ciência e tecnologia ( fct ) . the largest r & d units of the public universities by volume of research grants and peer-reviewed publications , include biosciences research institutions like the instituto de medicina molecular , the centre for neuroscience and cell biology , the ipatimup , the instituto de biologia molecular e celular and the abel salazar biomedical sciences institute .
when a historic document survives only in translation , the original having been lost , researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text . an example involves the novel the saragossa manuscript by the polish aristocrat jan potocki ( 1761–1815 ) , who wrote the novel in french and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14 . portions of the original french-language manuscript were subsequently lost ; however , the missing fragments survived in a polish translation that was made by edmund chojecki in 1847 from a complete french copy , now lost . french-language versions of the complete saragossa manuscript have since been produced , based on extant french-language fragments and on french-language versions that have been back-translated from chojecki ’ s polish version .
central catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the highest number of speakers . it is spoken in the densely populated regions of the barcelona province , the eastern half of the province of tarragona , and most of the province of girona .
the christian population of the empire , owing to their higher educational levels , started to pull ahead of the muslim majority , leading to much resentment on the part of the latter . in 1861 , there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for ottoman christians with 140,000 pupils in total , a figure that vastly exceeded the number of muslim children in school at the same time , who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning arabic and islamic theology . in turn , the higher educational levels of the christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy . in 1911 , of the 654 wholesale companies in istanbul , 528 were owned by ethnic greeks . of course , it would be a mistake to ignore the geopolitical dimensions of this dynamic . the preponderance of christian merchants owed not to any innate business sense on their part , although plenty of european observers were keen on making this point . in fact , in many cases , christians and also jews were able to gain protection from european consuls and citizenship , meaning they were protected from ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their muslim comrades .
plymouth is home to the marine biological association of the united kingdom ( mba ) which conducts research in all areas of the marine sciences . the plymouth marine laboratory is an offshoot of the mba . together with the national marine aquarium , the sir alister hardy foundation for ocean sciences , plymouth university 's marine institute and the diving diseases research centre , these marine-related organisations form the plymouth marine sciences partnership . the plymouth marine laboratory , which focuses on global issues of climate change and sustainability . it monitors the effects of ocean acidity on corals and shellfish and reports the results to the uk government . it also cultivates algae that could be used to make biofuels or in the treatment of waste water by using technology such as photo-bioreactors . it works alongside the boots group to investigate the use of algae in skin care protects , taking advantage of the chemicals they contain that adapt to protect themselves from the sun .
in towns , which expanded greatly during the period , landowners turned into property developers , and rows of identical terraced houses became the norm . even the wealthy were persuaded to live in these in town , especially if provided with a square of garden in front of the house . there was an enormous amount of building in the period , all over the english-speaking world , and the standards of construction were generally high . where they have not been demolished , large numbers of georgian buildings have survived two centuries or more , and they still form large parts of the core of cities such as london , edinburgh , dublin and bristol .
on november 18 , 1990 , the ukrainian autocephalous orthodox church enthroned mstyslav as patriarch of kiev and all ukraine during ceremonies at saint sophia 's cathedral . also on november 18 , canada announced that its consul-general to kiev would be ukrainian-canadian nestor gayowsky . on november 19 , the united states announced that its consul to kiev would be ukrainian-american john stepanchuk . on november 19 , the chairmen of the ukrainian and russian parliaments , respectively , kravchuk and yeltsin , signed a 10-year bilateral pact . in early december 1990 the party of democratic rebirth of ukraine was founded ; on december 15 , the democratic party of ukraine was founded .
though the ipod was released in 2001 , its price and mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004 . the ipod line came from apple 's " digital hub " category , when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices . digital cameras , camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets , but the company found existing digital music players " big and clunky or small and useless " with user interfaces that were " unbelievably awful , " so apple decided to develop its own . as ordered by ceo steve jobs , apple 's hardware engineering chief jon rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the ipod line , including hardware engineers tony fadell and michael dhuey , and design engineer sir jonathan ive . rubinstein had already discovered the toshiba disk drive when meeting with an apple supplier in japan , and purchased the rights to it for apple , and had also already worked out how the screen , battery , and other key elements would work . the aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 braun t3 transistor radio designed by dieter rams , while the wheel based user interface was prompted by bang & olufsen 's beocom 6000 telephone . the product ( " the walkman of the twenty-first century " ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on october 23 , 2001 . jobs announced it as a mac-compatible product with a 5 gb hard drive that put " 1,000 songs in your pocket . "
as white settlers began populating montana from the 1850s through the 1870s , disputes with native americans ensued , primarily over land ownership and control . in 1855 , washington territorial governor isaac stevens negotiated the hellgate treaty between the united states government and the salish , pend d'oreille , and the kootenai people of western montana , which established boundaries for the tribal nations . the treaty was ratified in 1859 . while the treaty established what later became the flathead indian reservation , trouble with interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led whites to believe that the bitterroot valley was opened to settlement , but the tribal nations disputed those provisions . the salish remained in the bitterroot valley until 1891 .
usually a presbyterian church will not have statues of saints , nor the ornate altar more typical of a roman catholic church . instead , one will find a " communion table , " usually on the same level as the congregation . there may be a rail between the communion table and the " chancel " behind it , which may contain a more decorative altar-type table , choir loft , or choir stalls , lectern and clergy area . the altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the chancel by presbyterians . in a presbyterian ( reformed church ) there may be an altar cross , either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel . by using the " empty " cross , or cross of the resurrection , presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that christ is not continually dying , but died once and is alive for all eternity . some presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center , or celtic cross . this not only emphasized the resurrection , but also acknowledges historical aspects of presbyterianism . a baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area . presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism . you may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible . some presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of christ or graven scenes from the last supper located behind the chancel . st. giles cathedral ( church of scotland- the mother church of presbyterians ) does have a crucifix next to one of the pulpits that hangs alongside . the image of christ is more of faint image and more modern design .
as of 2009 , dial up , wireless and satellite services were available . dial up internet services in somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent , with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5 % . the increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various somali telecom operators , including free local in-town calls , a flat rate of $ 10 per month for unlimited calls , a low charge of $ 0.005 per minute for internet connections , and a one-time connection fee of $ 50 . global internet company , a firm jointly owned by the major somali telecommunication networks hormuud telecom , telcom somalia and nationlink , was the country 's largest isp . it was at the time the only provider of dial up services in somalia 's south-central regions . in the northern puntland and somaliland regions , online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers . among these firms was golis telecom somalia in the northeast and telesom in the northwest .
since 2001 , miami has been undergoing a large building boom with more than 50 skyscrapers rising over 400 feet ( 122 m ) built or currently under construction in the city . miami 's skyline is ranked third-most impressive in the u.s. , behind new york city and chicago , and 19th in the world according to the almanac of architecture and design . the city currently has the eight tallest ( as well as thirteen of the fourteen tallest ) skyscrapers in the state of florida , with the tallest being the 789-foot ( 240 m ) four seasons hotel & tower .
historians trace the earliest church labeled baptist back to 1609 in amsterdam , with english separatist john smyth as its pastor . in accordance with his reading of the new testament , he rejected baptism of infants and instituted baptism only of believing adults . baptist practice spread to england , where the general baptists considered christ 's atonement to extend to all people , while the particular baptists believed that it extended only to the elect . in 1638 , roger williams established the first baptist congregation in the north american colonies . in the mid-18th century , the first great awakening increased baptist growth in both new england and the south . the second great awakening in the south in the early 19th century increased church membership , as did the preachers ' lessening of support for abolition and manumission of slavery , which had been part of the 18th-century teachings . baptist missionaries have spread their church to every continent .
coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs . leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs , and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of the dog 's size or ferocity . tigers in manchuria , indochina , indonesia , and malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards . striped hyenas are major predators of village dogs in turkmenistan , india , and the caucasus . reptiles such as alligators and pythons have been known to kill and eat dogs .
from childhood , gaddafi was aware of the involvement of european colonialists in libya ; his nation was occupied by italy , and during the north african campaign of world war ii it witnessed conflict between italian and british troops . according to later claims , gaddafi 's paternal grandfather , abdessalam bouminyar , was killed by the italian army during the italian invasion of 1911 . at world war ii 's end in 1945 , libya was occupied by british and french forces . although britain and france intended on dividing the nation between their empires , the general assembly of the united nations ( un ) declared that the country be granted political independence . in 1951 , the un created the united kingdom of libya , a federal state under the leadership of a pro-western monarch , idris , who banned political parties and established an absolute monarchy .
the first phase of eddy street commons , a $ 215 million development located adjacent to the university of notre dame campus and funded by the university , broke ground on june 3 , 2008 . the eddy street commons drew union protests when workers hired by the city of south bend to construct the public parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union workers . the developer , kite realty out of indianapolis , has made agreements with major national chains rather than local businesses , a move that has led to criticism from alumni and students .
the history of biodiversity during the phanerozoic ( the last 540 million years ) , starts with rapid growth during the cambrian explosion—a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared . over the next 400 million years or so , invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend , and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend . this dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic , massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events . a significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous . the worst was the permian-triassic extinction event , 251 million years ago . vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event .
another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups . the mid-20th-century anthropologist william c. boyd defined race as : " a population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses . it is an arbitrary matter which , and how many , gene loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation ' " . leonard lieberman and rodney kirk have pointed out that " the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing . " moreover , the anthropologist stephen molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless . the human genome project states " people who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some alleles in common , but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other . "
immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude . many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time . the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between " cellular " and " humoral " theories of immunity . according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells – more precisely , phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses . in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held by robert koch and emil von behring , among others , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components ( molecules ) found in the organism ’ s “ humors ” rather than its cells .
anarchists are against the state but are not against political organization or " governance " —so long as it is self-governance utilizing direct democracy . the mode of political organization preferred by anarchists , in general , is federalism or confederalism . [ citation needed ] however , the anarchist definition of federalism tends to differ from the definition of federalism assumed by pro-state political scientists . the following is a brief description of federalism from section i.5 of an anarchist faq :
bateman was responsible for the building of 36 new buildings for the university both on and off campus , including the expansion of the harold b. lee library . he was also one of several key college leaders who brought about the creation of the mountain west conference , which byu 's athletics program joined — byu previously participated in the western athletic conference . a byu satellite tv network also opened in 2000 under his leadership . bateman was also president during the september 11th attacks in 2001 . the planes crashed on a tuesday , hours before the weekly devotional normally held at byu . previous plans for the devotional were altered , as bateman led the student body in a prayer for peace . bateman was followed by cecil o. samuelson in 2003 . samuelson was succeeded by kevin j worthen in 2014 .
the record transfer fee for a premier league player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition . prior to the start of the first premier league season alan shearer became the first british player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million . the record rose steadily in the premier league 's first few seasons , until alan shearer made a record breaking £15 million move to newcastle united in 1996 . the three highest transfer in the sport 's history had a premier league club on the selling end , with tottenham hotspur selling gareth bale to real madrid for £85 million in 2013 , manchester united 's sale of cristiano ronaldo to real madrid for £80 million in 2009 , and liverpool selling luis suárez to barcelona for £75 million in 2014 .
the fund raises awareness of and supports efforts to meet these needs in developing countries , advocates close attention to population concerns , and helps developing nations formulate policies and strategies in support of sustainable development . dr. osotimehin assumed leadership in january 2011 . the fund is also represented by unfpa goodwill ambassadors and a patron .
some of the later writers about the show were more positive , michael slezak , again of entertainment weekly , thought that " for all its bloated , synthetic , product-shilling , money-making trappings , idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average american to combat the evils of today 's music business . " singer sheryl crow , who was later to act as a mentor on the show , however took the view that the show " undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism " . pop music critic ann powers nevertheless suggested that idol has " reshaped the american songbook " , " led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture " , and connects " the classic hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future . " others focused on the personalities in the show ; ramin setoodeh of newsweek accused judge simon cowell 's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness , that " simon cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him . " some such as singer john mayer disparaged the contestants , suggesting that those who appeared on idol are not real artists with self-respect .
compact disc ( cd ) is a digital optical disc data storage format . the format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data ( cd-rom ) . several other formats were further derived from these , including write-once audio and data storage ( cd-r ) , rewritable media ( cd-rw ) , video compact disc ( vcd ) , super video compact disc ( svcd ) , photo cd , picturecd , cd-i , and enhanced music cd . audio cds and audio cd players have been commercially available since october 1982 .
although professional wrestling in mexico ( lucha libre ) also has stories and characters , they are less emphasized . wrestlers in mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the u.s. who , more often , rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents . the difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the cruiserweight division ( peso semicompleto ) are often the most popular wrestlers in mexican lucha libre . wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the wrestling ring 's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents , using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession , and applying complex submission holds . lucha libre is also known for its tag team wrestling matches , in which the teams are often made up of three members , instead of two as is common in the u.s .
the northern russian dialects and those spoken along the volga river typically pronounce unstressed /o/ clearly ( the phenomenon called okanye/оканье ) . besides the absence of vowel reduction , some dialects have high or diphthongal /e~i̯ɛ/ in the place of proto-slavic *ě and /o~u̯ɔ/ in stressed closed syllables ( as in ukrainian ) instead of standard russian /e/ and /o/ . an interesting morphological feature is a post-posed definite article -to , -ta , -te similarly to that existing in bulgarian and macedonian .
since the 2006 fifa world cup , the internal and external evaluation of germany 's national image has changed . in the annual nation brands index global survey , germany became significantly and repeatedly more highly ranked after the tournament . people in 20 different states assessed the country 's reputation in terms of culture , politics , exports , its people and its attractiveness to tourists , immigrants and investments . germany has been named the world 's second most valued nation among 50 countries in 2010 . another global opinion poll , for the bbc , revealed that germany is recognised for the most positive influence in the world in 2010 . a majority of 59 % have a positive view of the country , while 14 % have a negative view .
in the dystopian future world of george orwell 's nineteen eighty-four , the times has been transformed into the organ of the totalitarian ruling party , its editorials—of which several are quoted in the book—reflecting big brother 's pronouncements .
the model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently . for example , short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information . in a study by zlonoga and gerber ( 1986 ) , patient 'kf ' demonstrated certain deviations from the atkinson–shiffrin model . patient kf was brain damaged , displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory . recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers , letters , words and easily identifiable noises ( such as doorbells and cats meowing ) were all impacted . interestingly , visual short-term memory was unaffected , suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory .
in addition , federal records centers exist in each region that house materials owned by federal agencies . federal records centers are not open for public research . for example , the frc in lenexa , kansas holds items from the treatment of john f. kennedy after his fatal shooting in 1963 .
several certification programs exist to support the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists . no certification now offered actually requires the applicant to show their ability to test software . no certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge . this has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification . certification itself can not measure an individual 's productivity , their skill , or practical knowledge , and can not guarantee their competence , or professionalism as a tester .
new haven 's economy originally was based in manufacturing , but the postwar period brought rapid industrial decline ; the entire northeast was affected , and medium-sized cities with large working-class populations , like new haven , were hit particularly hard . simultaneously , the growth and expansion of yale university further affected the economic shift . today , over half ( 56 % ) of the city 's economy is now made up of services , in particular education and health care ; yale is the city 's largest employer , followed by yale – new haven hospital . other large employers include st. raphael hospital , smilow cancer hospital , southern connecticut state university , assa abloy manufacturing , the knights of columbus headquarters , higher one , alexion pharmaceuticals , covidien and united illuminating . yale and yale-new haven are also among the largest employers in the state , and provide more $ 100,000+-salaried positions than any other employer in connecticut .

tito 's estrangement from the ussr enabled yugoslavia to obtain us aid via the economic cooperation administration ( eca ) , the same us aid institution which administered the marshall plan . still , he did not agree to align with the west , which was a common consequence of accepting american aid at the time . after stalin 's death in 1953 , relations with the ussr were relaxed and he began to receive aid as well from the comecon . in this way , tito played east-west antagonism to his advantage . instead of choosing sides , he was instrumental in kick-starting the non-aligned movement , which would function as a 'third way ' for countries interested in staying outside of the east-west divide .
one of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases . some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness . the human strains of ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after . as a result , the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone . also , this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye . thus , the initial stage of ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging . as a result of the above features , the spread of ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area . in contrast , the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system . as a result , many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease . also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
mexico city remains the only latin american city to host the olympic games , having held the summer olympics in 1968 , winning bids against buenos aires , lyon and detroit . ( this too will change thanks to rio , 2016 summer games host ) . the city hosted the 1955 and 1975 pan american games , the last after santiago and são paulo withdrew . the icf flatwater racing world championships were hosted here in 1974 and 1994 . lucha libre is a mexican style of wrestling , and is one of the more popular sports throughout the country . the main venues in the city are arena méxico and arena coliseo .
it was imperative for japanese commanders to hold saipan . the only way to do this was to destroy the u.s. fifth fleet , which had 15 fleet carriers and 956 planes , 7 battleships , 28 submarines , and 69 destroyers , as well as several light and heavy cruisers . vice admiral jisaburo ozawa attacked with nine-tenths of japan 's fighting fleet , which included nine carriers with 473 planes , 5 battleships , several cruisers , and 28 destroyers . ozawa 's pilots were outnumbered 2:1 and their aircraft were becoming or were already obsolete . the japanese had considerable antiaircraft defenses but lacked proximity fuzes or good radar . with the odds against him , ozawa devised an appropriate strategy . his planes had greater range because they were not weighed down with protective armor ; they could attack at about 480 km ( 300 mi ) [ citation needed ] , and could search a radius of 900 km [ citation needed ] ( 560 mi ) . u.s. navy hellcat fighters could only attack within 200 miles ( 320 km ) and only search within a 325-mile ( 523 km ) [ citation needed ] radius . ozawa planned to use this advantage by positioning his fleet 300 miles ( 480 km ) [ citation needed ] out . the japanese planes would hit the u.s. carriers , land at guam to refuel , then hit the enemy again when returning to their carriers . ozawa also counted on about 500 land-based planes at guam and other islands .
in the second half of '90s , mp3 files began to spread on the internet . the popularity of mp3s began to rise rapidly with the advent of nullsoft 's audio player winamp , released in 1997 . in 1998 , the first portable solid state digital audio player mpman , developed by saehan information systems which is headquartered in seoul , south korea , was released and the rio pmp300 was sold afterwards in 1998 , despite legal suppression efforts by the riaa .
in general , continental freemasonry is sympathetic to freemasonry amongst women , dating from the 1890s when french lodges assisted the emergent co-masonic movement by promoting enough of their members to the 33rd degree of the ancient and accepted scottish rite to allow them , in 1899 , to form their own grand council , recognised by the other continental grand councils of that rite . the united grand lodge of england issued a statement in 1999 recognising the two women 's grand lodges there to be regular in all but the participants . while they were not , therefore , recognised as regular , they were part of freemasonry " in general " . the attitude of most regular anglo-american grand lodges remains that women freemasons are not legitimate masons .
rebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life , each running from conception to death . the doctrine of anattā ( sanskrit anātman ) rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging , eternal soul , as it is called in hinduism and christianity . according to buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self independent from the rest of the universe . buddhists also refer to themselves as the believers of the anatta doctrine—nairatmyavadin or anattavadin . rebirth in subsequent existences must be understood as the continuation of a dynamic , ever-changing process of pratītyasamutpāda ( " dependent arising " ) determined by the laws of cause and effect ( karma ) rather than that of one being , reincarnating from one existence to the next .
at the end of the balkan wars , the extent of greece 's territory and population had increased . in the following years , the struggle between king constantine i and charismatic prime minister eleftherios venizelos over the country 's foreign policy on the eve of world war i dominated the country 's political scene , and divided the country into two opposing groups . during parts of the first world war , greece had two governments ; a royalist pro-german government in athens and a venizelist pro-britain one in thessaloniki . the two governments were united in 1917 , when greece officially entered the war on the side of the triple entente .
following the defeat of the german empire in world war i and the abdication of the german emperor , some revolutionary insurgents declared alsace-lorraine as an independent republic , without preliminary referendum or vote . on 11 november 1918 ( armistice day ) , communist insurgents proclaimed a " soviet government " in strasbourg , following the example of kurt eisner in munich as well as other german towns . french troops commanded by french general henri gouraud entered triumphantly in the city on 22 november . a major street of the city now bears the name of that date ( rue du 22 novembre ) which celebrates the entry of the french in the city . viewing the massive cheering crowd gathered under the balcony of strasbourg 's town hall , french president raymond poincaré stated that " the plebiscite is done " .
there are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange , of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by bermuda 's regulatory environment . the exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities , debt issues , funds ( including hedge fund structures ) and depository receipt programmes . the bsx is a full member of the world federation of exchanges and is located in an oecd member nation . it also has approved stock exchange status under australia 's foreign investment fund ( fif ) taxation rules and designated investment exchange status by the uk 's financial services authority .
a desire to be closer to the urban scene has also attracted some young professionals to reside in inner ring suburbs such as grosse pointe and royal oak , detroit . detroit 's proximity to windsor , ontario , provides for views and nightlife , along with ontario 's minimum drinking age of 19 . a 2011 study by walk score recognized detroit for its above average walkability among large u.s. cities . about two-thirds of suburban residents occasionally dine and attend cultural events or take in professional games in the city of detroit .
the first degrees from the college were awarded in 1849 . the university was expanded with new buildings to accommodate more students and faculty . with each new president , new academic programs were offered and new buildings built to accommodate them . the original main building built by sorin just after he arrived was replaced by a larger " main building " in 1865 , which housed the university 's administration , classrooms , and dormitories . beginning in 1873 , a library collection was started by father lemonnier . by 1879 it had grown to ten thousand volumes that were housed in the main building .
from april–july , soviet and german officials made statements regarding the potential for the beginning of political negotiations , while no actual negotiations took place during that time period . the ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between germany and the soviet union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries , because close military and diplomatic connections , as was the case before the mid-1930s , had afterward been largely severed . in may , stalin replaced his foreign minister maxim litvinov , who was regarded as pro-western and who was also jewish , with vyacheslav molotov , allowing the soviet union more latitude in discussions with more parties , not only with britain and france .
the earth of the early archean ( 4,000 to 2,500 million years ago ) may have had a different tectonic style . during this time , the earth 's crust cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form . some scientists think because the earth was hotter , that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today , resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material . this may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the mantle cooled and convection slowed down . others argue that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to subduct and that the lack of archean rocks is a function of erosion and subsequent tectonic events .
the production for sulfidic zinc ores produces large amounts of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor . smelter slag and other residues of process also contain significant amounts of heavy metals . about 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the belgian towns of la calamine and plombières between 1806 and 1882 . the dumps of the past mining operations leach significant amounts of zinc and cadmium , and , as a result , the sediments of the geul river contain significant amounts of heavy metals . about two thousand years ago emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year . after increasing 10-fold from 1850 , zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes per year in the 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s , although a 2005 study of the arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline . anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20 to 1 .
cetaceans were historically abundant around the island as commercial hunts on the island was operating until 1956 . today , numbers of larger whales have disappeared , but even today many species such humpback whale , minke whale , sei whale , and dolphins can be observed close to shores , and scientific surveys have been conducted regularly . southern right whales were once regular migrants to the norfolk hence naming the island as the " middle ground " by whalers , but had been severely depleted by historical hunts , and further by illegal soviet and japan whaling , resulting in none of very few , if remnants still live , right whales in these regions along with lord howe island .
the attainment of high efficiency in blue leds was quickly followed by the development of the first white led . in this device a y 3al 5o 12 : ce ( known as " yag " ) phosphor coating on the emitter absorbs some of the blue emission and produces yellow light through fluorescence . the combination of that yellow with remaining blue light appears white to the eye . however using different phosphors ( fluorescent materials ) it also became possible to instead produce green and red light through fluorescence . the resulting mixture of red , green and blue is not only perceived by humans as white light but is superior for illumination in terms of color rendering , whereas one can not appreciate the color of red or green objects illuminated only by the yellow ( and remaining blue ) wavelengths from the yag phosphor .
historically , the name armenian has come to internationally designate this group of people . it was first used by neighbouring countries of ancient armenia . the earliest attestations of the exonym armenia date around the 6th century bc . in his trilingual behistun inscription dated to 517 bc , darius i the great of persia refers to urashtu ( in babylonian ) as armina ( in old persian ; armina ( ) and harminuya ( in elamite ) . in greek , αρμένιοι " armenians " is attested from about the same time , perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to hecataeus of miletus ( 476 bc ) . xenophon , a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions , describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc . he relates that the people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persians .
in 1840 , st helena became a provisioning station for the british west africa squadron , preventing slavery to brazil ( mainly ) , and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island . these were all african , and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the west indies and cape town , and eventually to sierra leone .
in 1994 , comcast became the third largest cable operator in the united states with around 3.5 million subscribers following its purchase of maclean-hunter 's american division for $ 1.27 billion . the company 's uk branch , comcast uk cable partners , goes public while constructing a cable telecommunications network . with five other media companies , the corporation becomes an original investor in the golf channel . following a bid in 1994 for $ 2.1 billion , comcast increased its ownership of qvc from 15.5 % of stock to a majority , in a move to prevent qvc from merging with cbs . comcast later sold its qvc shares in 2004 to liberty media for $ 7.9 billion .
on july 17 , 2012 , the crtc approved the shut down of cbc 's analogue transmitters , noting that " while the commission has the discretion to refuse to revoke broadcasting licences , even on application from a licensee , it can not direct the cbc or any other broadcaster to continue to operate its stations and transmitters . " on july 31 , 2012 , at around 11:59 p.m. in each time zone , the remaining 620 analogue transmitters were shut down , leaving the network with 27 digital television transmitters across the country , and some transmitters operated by some affiliated stations .
meanwhile , the industrial revolution laid open the door for mass production and consumption . aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products , once within the province of expensive craftsmanship , became cheaper under machine production .
at the end of the late middle ages , professional actors began to appear in england and europe . richard iii and henry vii both maintained small companies of professional actors . their plays were performed in the great hall of a nobleman 's residence , often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a " screen " at the other for the actors . also important were mummers ' plays , performed during the christmas season , and court masques . these masques were especially popular during the reign of henry viii who had a house of revels built and an office of revels established in 1545 .
electricity in the richmond metro area is provided by dominion virginia power . the company , based in richmond , is one of the nation 's largest producers of energy , serving retail energy customers in nine states . electricity is provided in the richmond area primarily by the north anna nuclear generating station and surry nuclear generating station , as well as a coal-fired station in chester , virginia . these three plants provide a total of 4,453 megawatts of power . several other natural gas plants provide extra power during times of peak demand . these include facilities in chester , and surry , and two plants in richmond ( gravel neck and darbytown ) .
with the advent of the industrial revolution , britain surged ahead of its european rivals . demand for indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war , and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production . as home to the revolution , britain experienced higher standards of living . its spiralling cycle of prosperity , demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade . the company became the single largest player in the british global market . william henry pyne notes in his book the microcosm of london ( 1808 ) that :
the city is governed pursuant to the home rule charter of the city of detroit . the city government is run by a mayor and a nine-member city council and clerk elected on an at-large nonpartisan ballot . since voters approved the city 's charter in 1974 , detroit has had a " strong mayoral " system , with the mayor approving departmental appointments . the council approves budgets but the mayor is not obligated to adhere to any earmarking . city ordinances and substantially large contracts must be approved by the council . the detroit city code is the codification of detroit 's local ordinances .
washington university in st. louis ( wash. u. , or wustl ) is a private research university located in st. louis , missouri , united states . founded in 1853 , and named after george washington , the university has students and faculty from all 50 u.s. states and more than 120 countries . twenty-five nobel laureates have been affiliated with washington university , nine having done the major part of their pioneering research at the university . washington university 's undergraduate program is ranked 15th by u.s. news and world report . the university is ranked 32nd in the world by the academic ranking of world universities .
alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting , and about 2000 years after " natural bronze " had come into general use [ citation needed ] . bronze artifacts from the vinča culture date to 4500 bc . sumerian and egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 bc . the bronze age began in southeastern europe around 3700–3300 bc , in northwestern europe about 2500 bc . it ended with the beginning of the iron age , 2000–1000 bc in the near east , 600 bc in northern europe . the transition between the neolithic period and the bronze age was formerly termed the chalcolithic period ( copper-stone ) , with copper tools being used with stone tools . this term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the chalcolithic and neolithic are coterminous at both ends . brass , an alloy of copper and zinc , is of much more recent origin . it was known to the greeks , but became a significant supplement to bronze during the roman empire .
football and cycling are the most popular sports in eritrea . in recent years , eritrean athletes have also seen increasing success in the international arena . zersenay tadese , an eritrean athlete , currently holds the world record in half marathon distance running . the tour of eritrea , a multi-stage international cycling event , is held annually throughout the country . the eritrea national cycling team has experienced a lot of success , winning the continental cycling championship several years in a row . six eritrean riders have been signed to international cycling teams , including natnael berhane and daniel teklehaimanot . berhane was named african sportsman of the year in 2013 , ahead of footballers yaya touré and didier drogba , while teklehaimanot became the first eritrean to ride the vuelta a españa in 2012 . in 2015 teklehaimanot won the king of the mountains classification in the critérium du dauphine . teklehaimanot and fellow eritrean merhawi kudus became the first black african riders to compete in the tour de france when they were selected by the mtn–qhubeka team for the 2015 edition of the race , where , on 9 july , teklehaimanot became the first african rider to wear the polkadot jersey .
the sell assessment of sexual orientation ( saso ) was developed to address the major concerns with the kinsey scale and klein sexual orientation grid and as such , measures sexual orientation on a continuum , considers various dimensions of sexual orientation , and considers homosexuality and heterosexuality separately . rather than providing a final solution to the question of how to best measure sexual orientation , the saso is meant to provoke discussion and debate about measurements of sexual orientation .
the second main principle , sola fide ( by faith alone ) , states that faith in christ is sufficient alone for eternal salvation . though argued from scripture , and hence logically consequent to sola scriptura , this is the guiding principle of the work of luther and the later reformers . because sola scriptura placed the bible as the only source of teaching , sola fide epitomises the main thrust of the teaching the reformers wanted to get back to , namely the direct , close , personal connection between christ and the believer , hence the reformers ' contention that their work was christocentric .
in the wake of the discovery , there was much nationalistic rivalry between the french and the british over who deserved credit for the discovery . eventually , an international consensus emerged that both le verrier and adams jointly deserved credit . since 1966 , dennis rawlins has questioned the credibility of adams 's claim to co-discovery , and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the " neptune papers " ( historical documents ) to the royal observatory , greenwich . after reviewing the documents , they suggest that " adams does not deserve equal credit with le verrier for the discovery of neptune . that credit belongs only to the person who succeeded both in predicting the planet 's place and in convincing astronomers to search for it . "
the first institute of madrasa education was at the estate of hazrat zaid bin arkam near a hill called safa , where hazrat muhammad was the teacher and the students were some of his followers . [ citation needed ] after hijrah ( migration ) the madrasa of " suffa " was established in madina on the east side of the al-masjid an-nabawi mosque . hazrat 'ubada bin samit was appointed there by hazrat muhammad as teacher and among the students . [ citation needed ] in the curriculum of the madrasa , there were teachings of the qur'an , the hadith , fara'iz , tajweed , genealogy , treatises of first aid , etc . there were also trainings of horse-riding , art of war , handwriting and calligraphy , athletics and martial arts . the first part of madrasa based education is estimated from the first day of " nabuwwat " to the first portion of the " umaiya " caliphate .

the remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in sepphoris , which was an important centre of jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by jews , christians and pagans . the mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of jewish and pagan beliefs . in the center of the floor the zodiac wheel was depicted . helios sits in the middle , in his sun chariot , and each zodiac is matched with a jewish month . along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting biblical scenes , such as the binding of isaac , as well as traditional rituals , including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains .
in all life is problem solving , popper sought to explain the apparent progress of scientific knowledge – that is , how it is that our understanding of the universe seems to improve over time . this problem arises from his position that the truth content of our theories , even the best of them , can not be verified by scientific testing , but can only be falsified . again , in this context the word " falsified " does not refer to something being " fake " ; rather , that something can be ( i.e. , is capable of being ) shown to be false by observation or experiment . some things simply do not lend themselves to being shown to be false , and therefore , are not falsifiable . if so , then how is it that the growth of science appears to result in a growth in knowledge ? in popper 's view , the advance of scientific knowledge is an evolutionary process characterised by his formula :
the city is also home to the heineken brewery that brews murphy 's irish stout and the nearby beamish and crawford brewery ( taken over by heineken in 2008 ) which have been in the city for generations . 45 % of the world 's tic tac sweets are manufactured at the city 's ferrero factory . for many years , cork was the home to ford motor company , which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984 . henry ford 's grandfather was from west cork , which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in cork . but technology has replaced the old manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s , with people now working in the many i.t . centres of the city – such as amazon.com , the online retailer , which has set up in cork airport business park .
northwestern is a large , residential research university . accredited by the north central association of colleges and schools and the respective national professional organizations for chemistry , psychology , business , education , journalism , music , engineering , law , and medicine , the university offers 124 undergraduate programs and 145 graduate and professional programs . northwestern conferred 2,190 bachelor 's degrees , 3,272 master 's degrees , 565 doctoral degrees , and 444 professional degrees in 2012–2013 .
the entire protestant canon of scripture is considered the inspired , inerrant word of god . jehovah 's witnesses consider the bible to be scientifically and historically accurate and reliable and interpret much of it literally , but accept parts of it as symbolic . they consider the bible to be the final authority for all their beliefs , although sociologist andrew holden 's ethnographic study of the religion concluded that pronouncements of the governing body , through watch tower society publications , carry almost as much weight as the bible . regular personal bible reading is frequently recommended ; witnesses are discouraged from formulating doctrines and " private ideas " reached through bible research independent of watch tower society publications , and are cautioned against reading other religious literature . adherents are told to have " complete confidence " in the leadership , avoid skepticism about what is taught in the watch tower society 's literature , and " not advocate or insist on personal opinions or harbor private ideas when it comes to bible understanding . " the religion makes no provision for members to criticize or contribute to official teachings and all witnesses must abide by its doctrines and organizational requirements .
like other american research universities , northwestern was transformed by world war ii . franklyn b. snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949 , when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the evanston and chicago campuses . after the war , surging enrollments under the g.i . bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses . in 1948 prominent anthropologist melville j. herskovits founded the program of african studies at northwestern , the first center of its kind at an american academic institution . j. roscoe miller 's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the evanston campus , with the construction of the lakefill on lake michigan , growth of the faculty and new academic programs , as well as polarizing vietnam-era student protests . in 1978 , the first and second unabomber attacks occurred at northwestern university . relations between evanston and northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism , disputes over municipal zoning , building codes , and law enforcement , as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972 . northwestern 's exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension .
religious festivals include diwali ( the festival of light ) , maha shivaratri , teej , guru nanak jayanti , baisakhi , durga puja , holi , lohri , eid ul-fitr , eid ul-adha , christmas , chhath puja and mahavir jayanti . the qutub festival is a cultural event during which performances of musicians and dancers from all over india are showcased at night , with the qutub minar as the chosen backdrop of the event . other events such as kite flying festival , international mango festival and vasant panchami ( the spring festival ) are held every year in delhi .
tennessee is known as the " volunteer state " , a nickname some claimed was earned during the war of 1812 because of the prominent role played by volunteer soldiers from tennessee , especially during the battle of new orleans . other sources differ on the origin of the state nickname ; according to the columbia encyclopedia , the name refers to volunteers for the mexican–american war . this explanation is more likely , because president polk 's call for 2,600 nationwide volunteers at the beginning of the mexican-american war resulted in 30,000 volunteers from tennessee alone , largely in response to the death of davy crockett and appeals by former tennessee governor and now texas politician , sam houston .

in britain , further experiments in the genre boosted its appeal . house and rave clubs such as lakota and cream emerged across britain , hosting house and dance scene events . the 'chilling out ' concept developed in britain with ambient house albums such as the klf 's chill out and analogue bubblebath by aphex twin . the godskitchen superclub brand also began in the midst of the early 90 's rave scene . after initially hosting small nights in cambridge and northampton , the associated events scaled up in milton keynes , birmingham and leeds . a new indie dance scene also emerged in the 90 's . in new york , bands such as deee-lite furthered house 's international influence . two distinctive tracks from this era were the orb 's " little fluffy clouds " ( with a distinctive vocal sample from rickie lee jones ) and the happy mondays ' " wrote for luck " ( " wfl " ) which was transformed into a dance hit by vince clarke .
many pubs were drinking establishments , and little emphasis was placed on the serving of food , other than sandwiches and " bar snacks " , such as pork scratchings , pickled eggs , salted crisps and peanuts which helped to increase beer sales . in south east england ( especially london ) it was common until recent times for vendors selling cockles , whelks , mussels , and other shellfish to sell to customers during the evening and at closing time . many mobile shellfish stalls would set up near pubs , a practice that continues in london 's east end . otherwise , pickled cockles and mussels may be offered by the pub in jars or packets .
the port of palermo , founded by the phoenicians over 2,700 years ago , is , together with the port of messina , the main port of sicily . from here ferries link palermo to cagliari , genoa , livorno , naples , tunis and other cities and carry a total of almost 2 million passengers annually . it is also an important port for cruise ships . traffic includes also almost 5 million tonnes of cargo and 80.000 teu yearly . the port also has links to minor sicilian islands such as ustica and the aeolian islands ( via cefalù in summer ) . inside the port of palermo there is a section known as " tourist marina " for sailing yachts and catamarans .
the bronx is named after jonas bronck who created the first settlement as part of the new netherland colony in 1639 . the native lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers . in the 19th and 20th centuries , the bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community , first from various european countries ( particularly ireland , germany and italy ) and later from the caribbean region ( particularly puerto rico , jamaica and the dominican republic ) , as well as african american migrants from the american south . this cultural mix has made the bronx a wellspring of both latin music and hip hop .
between 1815 and 1914 , a period referred to as britain 's " imperial century " by some historians , around 10,000,000 square miles ( 26,000,000 km2 ) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the british empire . victory over napoleon left britain without any serious international rival , other than russia in central asia . unchallenged at sea , britain adopted the role of global policeman , a state of affairs later known as the pax britannica , and a foreign policy of " splendid isolation " . alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies , britain 's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries , such as china , argentina and siam , which has been characterised by some historians as " informal empire " .

alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the swiss national identity . nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter , and a hiking ( ger : das wandern ) or mountain biking culture in summer . other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism , yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors . a traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities . folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country . in switzerland it is mostly expressed in music , dance , poetry , wood carving and embroidery . the alphorn , a trumpet-like musical instrument made of wood , has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of traditional swiss music .
the fate of willett 's 1907 proposal illustrates several political issues involved . the proposal attracted many supporters , including balfour , churchill , lloyd george , macdonald , edward vii ( who used half-hour dst at sandringham ) , the managing director of harrods , and the manager of the national bank . however , the opposition was stronger : it included prime minister h. h. asquith , christie ( the astronomer royal ) , george darwin , napier shaw ( director of the meteorological office ) , many agricultural organizations , and theatre owners . after many hearings the proposal was narrowly defeated in a parliament committee vote in 1909 . willett 's allies introduced similar bills every year from 1911 through 1914 , to no avail . the us was even more skeptical : andrew peters introduced a dst bill to the us house of representatives in may 1909 , but it soon died in committee .
market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist " between the current market malaise " and the great depression . he says the dow jones average 's fall of more than 50 % over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7 % fall in the great depression , followed by a total drop of 89 % over the following 16 months . " it 's very troubling if you have a mirror image , " said dow . floyd norris , the chief financial correspondent of the new york times , wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression , explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time , the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007 , and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow . the past two years ranked third , however .

red is the color at the end of the spectrum of visible light next to orange and opposite violet . red color has a predominant light wavelength of roughly 620–740 nanometres . red is one of the additive primary colors of visible light , along with green and blue , which in red green blue ( rgb ) color systems are combined to create all the colors on a computer monitor or television screen . red is also one of the subtractive primary colors , along with yellow and blue , of the ryb color space and traditional color wheel used by painters and artists .
with characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty . to clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years , an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the nicene formularies . in the meanwhile , julian , who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that athanasius was exercising at alexandria , addressed an order to ecdicius , the prefect of egypt , peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate , on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency . the edict was communicated to the bishop by pythicodorus trico , who , though described in the " chronicon athanasianum " ( xxxv ) as a " philosopher " , seems to have behaved with brutal insolence . on 23 october the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor 's decree ; but athanasius urged them to submit , consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration .
frustrated by the wasted effort , and with demands for action from their citizens , the allied force decided to attack the center of russian strength in the black sea at sevastopol on the crimean peninsula . after extended preparations , the forces landed on the peninsula in september 1854 and fought their way to a point south of sevastopol after a series of successful battles . the russians counterattacked on 25 october in what became the battle of balaclava and were repulsed , but at the cost of seriously depleting the british army forces . a second counterattack , ordered personally by nicholas , was defeated by omar pasha . the front settled into a siege and led to horrible conditions for troops on both sides . smaller actions were carried out in the baltic , the caucasus , the white sea and in the north pacific .
as of 2009 , dial up , wireless and satellite services were available . dial up internet services in somalia were among the fastest growing on the continent , with an annual landline growth rate of over 12.5 % . the increase in usage was largely due to innovative policy initiatives adopted by the various somali telecom operators , including free local in-town calls , a flat rate of $ 10 per month for unlimited calls , a low charge of $ 0.005 per minute for internet connections , and a one-time connection fee of $ 50 . global internet company , a firm jointly owned by the major somali telecommunication networks hormuud telecom , telcom somalia and nationlink , was the country 's largest isp . it was at the time the only provider of dial up services in somalia 's south-central regions . in the northern puntland and somaliland regions , online networks offered internet dial up services to their own group of subscribers . among these firms was golis telecom somalia in the northeast and telesom in the northwest .
between 1847 and 1850 , when blore was building the new east wing , the brighton pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings . as a result , many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere . the red and blue chinese luncheon room is made up from parts of the brighton banqueting and music rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by richard westmacott . the yellow drawing room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the brighton saloon , and a chimney piece which is a european vision of how the chinese chimney piece may appear . it has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons , designed by robert jones .
in the early 1970s the rolling stones developed their hard rock sound with exile on main st. ( 1972 ) . initially receiving mixed reviews , according to critic steve erlewine it is now " generally regarded as the rolling stones ' finest album " . they continued to pursue the riff-heavy sound on albums including it 's only rock 'n ' roll ( 1974 ) and black and blue ( 1976 ) . led zeppelin began to mix elements of world and folk music into their hard rock from led zeppelin iii ( 1970 ) and led zeppelin iv ( 1971 ) . the latter included the track " stairway to heaven " , which would become the most played song in the history of album-oriented radio . deep purple continued to define hard rock , particularly with their album machine head ( 1972 ) , which included the tracks " highway star " and " smoke on the water " . in 1975 guitarist ritchie blackmore left , going on to form rainbow and after the break-up of the band the next year , vocalist david coverdale formed whitesnake . 1970 saw the who release live at leeds , often seen as the archetypal hard rock live album , and the following year they released their highly acclaimed album who 's next , which mixed heavy rock with extensive use of synthesizers . subsequent albums , including quadrophenia ( 1973 ) , built on this sound before who are you ( 1978 ) , their last album before the death of pioneering rock drummer keith moon later that year .
the hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion . the rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters . the sophists proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism ; the belief in euhemerism ( the view that the gods were simply ancient kings and heroes ) , became popular . the popular philosopher epicurus promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia . the apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth . while there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity , this was mostly reserved for the educated classes .
this new approach liberated scientific speculation from the dogmatic restraints of aristotelian science , and paved the way for new approaches . particularly within the field of theories of motion great advances were made , when such scholars as jean buridan , nicole oresme and the oxford calculators challenged the work of aristotle . buridan developed the theory of impetus as the cause of the motion of projectiles , which was an important step towards the modern concept of inertia . the works of these scholars anticipated the heliocentric worldview of nicolaus copernicus .
in 1045 , the byzantine empire conquered bagratid armenia . soon , the other armenian states fell under byzantine control as well . the byzantine rule was short lived , as in 1071 seljuk turks defeated the byzantines and conquered armenia at the battle of manzikert , establishing the seljuk empire . to escape death or servitude at the hands of those who had assassinated his relative , gagik ii , king of ani , an armenian named roupen , went with some of his countrymen into the gorges of the taurus mountains and then into tarsus of cilicia . the byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the armenian kingdom of cilicia was eventually established on 6 january 1198 under king leo i , a descendant of prince roupen .
adult contemporary traces its roots to the 1960s easy listening format , which adopted a 70-80 % instrumental - 20-30 % vocal mix . a few offered 90 % instrumentals , and a handful were entirely instrumental . the easy listening format , as it was first known , was born of a desire by some radio stations in the late 1950s and early 1960s to continue playing current hit songs but distinguish themselves from being branded as " rock and roll " stations . billboard first published the easy listening chart july 17 , 1961 , with 20 songs ; the first number one was " boll weevil song " by brook benton . the chart described itself as " not too far out in either direction " .

an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen . the process also produces alumina , but the expensive gallium , which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets , can be re-used . this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy , as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported .
as there is no research indicating which of the three components is essential in defining sexual orientation , all three are used independently and provide different conclusions regarding sexual orientation . savin williams ( 2006 ) discusses this issue and notes that by basing findings regarding sexual orientation on a single component , researchers may not actually capture the intended population . for example , if homosexual is defined by same sex behavior , gay virgins are omitted , heterosexuals engaging in same sex behavior for other reasons than preferred sexual arousal are miscounted , and those with same sex attraction who only have opposite-sex relations are excluded . because of the limited populations that each component captures , consumers of research should be cautious in generalizing these findings .
an earthquake emergency relief team of 184 people ( consisting of 12 people from the state seismological bureau , 150 from the beijing military area command , and 22 from the armed police general hospital ) left beijing from nanyuan airport late may 12 in two military transport planes to travel to wenchuan county .
to allow for greater movement while dancing and singing , madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones , with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head , and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth . because of her prominent usage , the microphone design came to be known as the " madonna mic " . metz noted that madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance . while her big-screen performances are panned , her live performances are critical successes . madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos . author elin diamond explained that reciprocally , the fact that images from madonna 's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos . thus her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized . taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia , latest technology and sound systems , madonna 's concerts and live performances are deemed as " extravagant show piece , a walking art show . "
counting shipping as quasi-exports and in terms of monetary value , greece ranked 4th globally in 2011 having " exported " shipping services worth 17,704.132 million $ ; only denmark , germany and south korea ranked higher during that year . similarly counting shipping services provided to greece by other countries as quasi-imports and the difference between " exports " and " imports " as a " trade balance " , greece in 2011 ranked in the latter second behind germany , having " imported " shipping services worth 7,076.605 million us $ and having run a " trade surplus " of 10,712.342 million us $ .
this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity . it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage ( including mortgage brokers , specialized originators , the securitizers and their due diligence firms , managing agents and trading desks , and finally investors , insurances and providers of repo funding ) . with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information ( including fico scores on creditworthiness , appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations , and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks ) . instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts , misjudgments and finally market collapse . in 2005 a group of computer scientists built a computational model for the mechanism of biased ratings produced by rating agencies , which turned out to be adequate to what actually happened in 2006–2008 .

schwarzenegger became a naturalized u.s. citizen on september 17 , 1983 . shortly before he gained his citizenship , he asked the austrian authorities for the right to keep his austrian citizenship , as austria does not usually allow dual citizenship . his request was granted , and he retained his austrian citizenship . in 2005 , peter pilz , a member of the austrian parliament from the austrian green party , demanded that parliament revoke schwarzenegger 's austrian citizenship due to his decision not to prevent the executions of donald beardslee and stanley williams , causing damage of reputation to austria , where the death penalty has been abolished since 1968 . this demand was based on article 33 of the austrian citizenship act that states : " a citizen , who is in the public service of a foreign country , shall be deprived of his citizenship , if he heavily damages the reputation or the interests of the austrian republic . " pilz claimed that schwarzenegger 's actions in support of the death penalty ( prohibited in austria under protocol 13 of the european convention on human rights ) had indeed done damage to austria 's reputation . schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as governor of california was to prevent an error in the judicial system .

in 2006 , fig introduced a new points system for artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points . the system is used in the us for elite level competition . unlike the old code of points , there are two separate scores , an execution score and a difficulty score . in the previous system , the " execution score " was the only score . it was and still is out of 10.00 . during the gymnast 's performance , the judges deduct this score only . a fall , on or off the event , is a 1.00 deduction , in elite level gymnastics . the introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change . the gymnast 's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills , or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another . connection bonuses are the most common deduction from a difficulty score , as it can be difficult to connect multiple flight elements . it is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly . the new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of the skills they perform as well as their execution . there is no maximum score for difficulty , as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase .

by 750 , the feast of her conception was widely celebrated in the byzantine east , under the name of the conception ( active ) of saint anne . in the west it was known as the feast of the conception ( passive ) of mary , and was associated particularly with the normans , whether these introduced it directly from the east or took it from english usage . the spread of the feast , by now with the adjective " immaculate " attached to its title , met opposition on the part of some , on the grounds that sanctification was possible only after conception . critics included saints bernard of clairvaux , albertus magnus and thomas aquinas . other theologians defended the expression " immaculate conception " , pointing out that sanctification could be conferred at the first moment of conception in view of the foreseen merits of christ , a view held especially by franciscans .
the effective area or effective aperture of a receiving antenna expresses the portion of the power of a passing electromagnetic wave which it delivers to its terminals , expressed in terms of an equivalent area . for instance , if a radio wave passing a given location has a flux of 1 pw / m2 ( 10−12 watts per square meter ) and an antenna has an effective area of 12 m2 , then the antenna would deliver 12 pw of rf power to the receiver ( 30 microvolts rms at 75 ohms ) . since the receiving antenna is not equally sensitive to signals received from all directions , the effective area is a function of the direction to the source .
a study in 2007 by mark long , an economics professor at the university of washington , demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in california , texas , and washington . more specifically , apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states , and the beneficiaries of class-based ( not race ) affirmative action would be white students . at the same time , affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly : 52 percent of white populace ( compared to 14 percent of black ) thought it should be abolished , implying white distaste of using racial identity , and full-file review is expected to cost the universities an additional $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million per year , excluding possible cost of litigation .
japanese seismologist yuji yagi at the university of tsukuba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " the 155-mile longmenshan fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that sheared four yards . " his data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the great hanshin earthquake of 1995 in japan , which killed over 6,000 people . he pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . teruyuki kato , a seismologist at the university of tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central china . according to reports from chengdu , the capital of sichuan province , the earthquake tremors lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
as it has on every aspect of charleston culture , the gullah community has had a tremendous influence on music in charleston , especially when it comes to the early development of jazz music . in turn , the music of charleston has had an influence on that of the rest of the country . the geechee dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in charleston followed a rhythm that inspired eubie blake 's " charleston rag " and later james p. johnson 's " the charleston " , as well as the dance craze that defined a nation in the 1920s . " ballin ' the jack " , which was a popular dance in the years before " the charleston " , was written by native charlestonian chris smith .
mathematics : the earliest traces of mathematical knowledge in the indian subcontinent appear with the indus valley civilization ( c. 4th millennium bc ~ c. 3rd millennium bc ) . the people of this civilization made bricks whose dimensions were in the proportion 4:2:1 , considered favorable for the stability of a brick structure . they also tried to standardize measurement of length to a high degree of accuracy . they designed a ruler—the mohenjo-daro ruler—whose unit of length ( approximately 1.32 inches or 3.4 centimetres ) was divided into ten equal parts . bricks manufactured in ancient mohenjo-daro often had dimensions that were integral multiples of this unit of length .
dell had a reputation as a company that relied upon supply chain efficiencies to sell established technologies at low prices , instead of being an innovator . by the mid-2000s many analysts were looking to innovating companies as the next source of growth in the technology sector . dell 's low spending on r & d relative to its revenue ( compared to ibm , hewlett packard , and apple inc. ) —which worked well in the commoditized pc market—prevented it from making inroads into more lucrative segments , such as mp3 players and later mobile devices . increasing spending on r & d would have cut into the operating margins that the company emphasized . dell had done well with a horizontal organization that focused on pcs when the computing industry moved to horizontal mix-and-match layers in the 1980s , but by the mid-2000 the industry shifted to vertically integrated stacks to deliver complete it solutions and dell lagged far behind competitors like hewlett packard and oracle .
while antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea , they are usually not used except in specific situations . there are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with escherichia coli o157 : h7 . in resource-poor countries , treatment with antibiotics may be beneficial . however , some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance , particularly shigella . antibiotics can also cause diarrhea , and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of treatment with general antibiotics .
from their beginnings in sumer ( now iraq ) around 3500 bc , the mesopotamian people began to attempt to record some observations of the world with numerical data . but their observations and measurements were seemingly taken for purposes other than for elucidating scientific laws . a concrete instance of pythagoras ' law was recorded , as early as the 18th century bc : the mesopotamian cuneiform tablet plimpton 322 records a number of pythagorean triplets ( 3,4,5 ) ( 5,12,13 ) . ... , dated 1900 bc , possibly millennia before pythagoras , but an abstract formulation of the pythagorean theorem was not .
at the time the store was introduced , purchased audio files used the aac format with added encryption , based on the fairplay drm system . up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of ipods could play the files . burning the files with itunes as an audio cd , then re-importing would create music files without the drm . the drm could also be removed using third-party software . however , in a deal with apple , emi began selling drm-free , higher-quality songs on the itunes stores , in a category called " itunes plus . " while individual songs were made available at a cost of us $ 1.29 , 30¢ more than the cost of a regular drm song , entire albums were available for the same price , us $ 9.99 , as drm encoded albums . on october 17 , 2007 , apple lowered the cost of individual itunes plus songs to us $ 0.99 per song , the same as drm encoded tracks . on january 6 , 2009 , apple announced that drm has been removed from 80 % of the music catalog , and that it would be removed from all music by april 2009 .
von neumann liked to eat and drink ; his wife , klara , said that he could count everything except calories . he enjoyed yiddish and " off-color " humor ( especially limericks ) . he was a non-smoker . at princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud german march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including albert einstein , from their work . von neumann did some of his best work blazingly fast in noisy , chaotic environments , and once admonished his wife for preparing a quiet study for him to work in . he never used it , preferring the couple 's living room with its television playing loudly .
beyoncé and husband jay z are friends with president barack obama and first lady michelle obama . she performed " america the beautiful " at the 2009 presidential inauguration , as well as " at last " during the first inaugural dance at the neighborhood ball two days later . beyoncé and jay z held a fundraiser at the latter 's 40/40 club in manhattan for obama 's 2012 presidential campaign which raised $ 4 million . beyoncé uploaded pictures of her paper ballot on tumblr , confirming she had voted in support for the democratic party and to encourage others to do so . she also performed the american national anthem at his second inauguration , singing along with a pre-recorded track . she publicly endorsed same sex marriage on march 26 , 2013 , after the supreme court debate on california 's proposition 8 . in july 2013 , beyoncé and jay-z attended a rally in response to the acquittal of george zimmerman for the shooting of trayvon martin .
in eastern pennsylvania the great appalachian valley , or great valley , was accessible by reason of a broad gateway between the end of south mountain and the highlands , and many germans and moravians settled here between the susquehanna and delaware rivers forming the pennsylvania dutch community , some of whom even now speak a unique american dialect of german known as the " pennsylvania german language " or " pennsylvania dutch . " these latecomers to the new world were forced to the frontier to find cheap land . with their followers of both german , english and scots-irish origin , they worked their way southward and soon occupied all of the shenandoah valley , ceded by the iroquois , and the upper reaches of the great valley tributaries of the tennessee river , ceded by the cherokee .
around this time , tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president núñez 's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group , boixos nois . the group , identified with a left-wing separatism , repeatedly demanded the resignation of núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches . at the same time , barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads , who often identified with a right-wing separatism . the skinheads slowly transferred the boixos nois ' ideology from liberalism to fascism , which caused division within the group and a sudden support for núñez 's presidency . inspired by british hooligans , the remaining boixos nois became violent , causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests .
the hebrew bible , a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the jews , established the first of the abrahamic religions , which are now practiced by 54 % of the world . judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief , and has been called not only a religion , but also a " way of life , " which has made drawing a clear distinction between judaism , jewish culture , and jewish identity rather difficult . throughout history , in eras and places as diverse as the ancient hellenic world , in europe before and after the age of enlightenment ( see haskalah ) , in islamic spain and portugal , in north africa and the middle east , india , china , or the contemporary united states and israel , cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically jewish without being at all specifically religious . some factors in this come from within judaism , others from the interaction of jews or specific communities of jews with their surroundings , others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community , as opposed to from the religion itself . this phenomenon has led to considerably different jewish cultures unique to their own communities , each as authentically jewish as the next .
after a three-year hiatus , a fifth digimon series began airing on april 2 , 2006 . like frontier , savers has no connection with the previous installments , and also marks a new start for the digimon franchise , with a drastic change in character designs and story-line , in order to reach a broader audience . the story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of d.a.t.s . ( " digital accident tactics squad " ) , an organization created to conceal the existence of the digital world and digimon from the rest of mankind , and secretly solve any digimon-related incidents occurring on earth . later the d.a.t.s . is dragged into a massive conflict between earth and the digital world , triggered by an ambitious human scientist named akihiro kurata , determined to make use of the digimon for his own personal gains . the english version was dubbed by studiopolis and it premiered on the jetix block on toon disney on october 1 , 2007 . digivolution in data squad requires the human partner 's dna ( " digital natural ability " in the english version and " digisoul " in the japanese version ) to activate , a strong empathy with their digimon and a will to succeed . 'digimon savers ' also introduces a new form of digivolving called burst mode which is essentially the level above mega ( previously the strongest form a digimon could take ) . like previously in tamers , this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed , originally in japan , at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21 . because of that , along with the designs , the anime being heavily edited and localized for western us audiences like past series , and the english dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower tv-y7-fv rating just like past dubs , studiopolis dubbed the anime on jetix with far more edits , changes , censorship , and cut footage . this included giving the japanese characters full americanized names and american surnames as well as applying far more americanization ( marcus damon as opposed to the japanese daimon masaru ) , cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4kids often made ( such as removal of japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining ) . despite all that , the setting of the country was still in japan and the characters were japanese in the dub . this series was the first to show any japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with american audiences ( such as the manju ) , which were left unedited and used in the english dub . also despite the heavy censorship and the english dub aimed at young children , some of the digimon 's attacks named after real weapons such as rizegreymon 's trident revolver are not edited and used in the english dub . well go usa released it on dvd instead of disney . the north american english dub was televised on jetix in the u.s. and on the family channel in canada .
for the finals , american idol debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on march 11 , 2008 , along with a new on-air look . david cook 's performance of " billie jean " on top-ten night was lauded by the judges , but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the chris cornell arrangement to be david cook 's own even though the performance was introduced as cornell 's version . cornell himself said he was 'flattered ' and praised david cook 's performance . david cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure .
since the 2010 election , the government has embarked on a series of reforms to direct the country towards liberal democracy , a mixed economy , and reconciliation , although doubts persist about the motives that underpin such reforms . the series of reforms includes the release of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi from house arrest , the establishment of the national human rights commission , the granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners , new labour laws that permit labour unions and strikes , a relaxation of press censorship , and the regulation of currency practices .
present-day statutes from across the nation use the same words and phrases , requiring modern executions to take place within a wall or enclosure to exclude public view . connecticut general statute § 54–100 requires death sentences to be conducted in an " enclosure " which " shall be so constructed as to exclude public view . " kentucky revised statute 431.220 and missouri revised statute § 546.730 contain substantially identical language . new mexico 's former death penalty , since repealed , see n.m. stat . § 31-14-12 , required executions be conducted in a " room or place enclosed from public view . " similarly , a dormant massachusetts law , see mass . gen. law ch . 279 § 60 , required executions to take place " within an enclosure or building . " north carolina general statute § 15-188 requires death sentences to be executed " within the walls " of the penitentiary , as do oklahoma statute title 22 § 1015 and montana code § 46-19-103 . ohio revised code § 2949.22 requires that " [ t ] he enclosure shall exclude public view . " similarly , tennessee code § 40-23-116 requires " an enclosure " for " strict seclusion and privacy . " united states code title 18 § 3596 and the code of federal regulations 28 cfr 26.4 limit the witnesses permitted at federal executions .
chain department stores grew rapidly after 1920 , and provided competition for the downtown upscale department stores , as well as local department stores in small cities . j. c. penney had four stores in 1908 , 312 in 1920 , and 1452 in 1930 . sears , roebuck & company , a giant mail-order house , opened its first eight retail stores in 1925 , and operated 338 by 1930 , and 595 by 1940 . the chains reached a middle-class audience , that was more interested in value than in upscale fashions . sears was a pioneer in creating department stores that catered to men as well as women , especially with lines of hardware and building materials . it deemphasized the latest fashions in favor of practicality and durability , and allowed customers to select goods without the aid of a clerk . its stores were oriented to motorists – set apart from existing business districts amid residential areas occupied by their target audience ; had ample , free , off-street parking ; and communicated a clear corporate identity . in the 1930s , the company designed fully air-conditioned , " windowless " stores whose layout was driven wholly by merchandising concerns .
whitehead 's most complete work on education is the 1929 book the aims of education and other essays , which collected numerous essays and addresses by whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927 . the essay from which aims of education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when whitehead was president of the london branch of the mathematical association . in it , he cautioned against the teaching of what he called " inert ideas " – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information , with no application to real life or culture . he opined that " education with inert ideas is not only useless : it is , above all things , harmful . "
the term " modern " was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times ( ultimately derived from the latin adverb modo , meaning " just now ) . the european renaissance ( about 1420–1630 ) , which marked the transition between the late middle ages and early modern times , started in italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of classical art and literature , as well as the new perspectives gained from the age of discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope , expanding the borders of thought and knowledge .
greater london encompasses a total area of 1,583 square kilometres ( 611 sq mi ) , an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 11,760/sq mi ) . the extended area known as the london metropolitan region or the london metropolitan agglomeration , comprises a total area of 8,382 square kilometres ( 3,236 sq mi ) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 3,900/sq mi ) . modern london stands on the thames , its primary geographical feature , a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east . the thames valley is a floodplain surrounded by gently rolling hills including parliament hill , addington hills , and primrose hill . the thames was once a much broader , shallower river with extensive marshlands ; at high tide , its shores reached five times their present width .
in 1214 john began his final campaign to reclaim normandy from philip . john was optimistic , as he had successfully built up alliances with the emperor otto , renaud of boulogne and count ferdinand of flanders ; he was enjoying papal favour ; and he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army . nonetheless , when john left for poitou in february 1214 , many barons refused to provide military service ; mercenary knights had to fill the gaps . john 's plan was to split philip 's forces by pushing north-east from poitou towards paris , whilst otto , renaud and ferdinand , supported by william longespée , marched south-west from flanders .
the colloquialism " buck " ( s ) ( much like the british word " quid " ( s , pl ) for the pound sterling ) is often used to refer to dollars of various nations , including the u.s. dollar . this term , dating to the 18th century , may have originated with the colonial leather trade . it may also have originated from a poker term . " greenback " is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century demand note dollars created by abraham lincoln to finance the costs of the civil war for the north . the original note was printed in black and green on the back side . it is still used to refer to the u.s. dollar ( but not to the dollars of other countries ) . other well-known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include " greenmail " , " green " and " dead presidents " ( the last because deceased presidents are pictured on most bills ) .
the assumption that black-body radiation is thermal leads to an accurate prediction : the total amount of emitted energy goes up with the temperature according to a definite rule , the stefan–boltzmann law ( 1879–84 ) . but it was also known that the colour of the light given off by a hot object changes with the temperature , so that " white hot " is hotter than " red hot " . nevertheless , wilhelm wien discovered the mathematical relationship between the peaks of the curves at different temperatures , by using the principle of adiabatic invariance . at each different temperature , the curve is moved over by wien 's displacement law ( 1893 ) . wien also proposed an approximation for the spectrum of the object , which was correct at high frequencies ( short wavelength ) but not at low frequencies ( long wavelength ) . it still was not clear why the spectrum of a hot object had the form that it has ( see diagram ) .
ajahn sucitto describes the path as " a mandala of interconnected factors that support and moderate each other . " the eight factors of the path are not to be understood as stages , in which each stage is completed before moving on to the next . rather , they are understood as eight significant dimensions of one 's behaviour—mental , spoken , and bodily—that operate in dependence on one another ; taken together , they define a complete path , or way of living .
replaygain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an mp3 file ( audio normalization ) in its metadata tag , enabling a replaygain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file . mp3gain may be used to reversibly modify files based on replaygain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without replaygain capability .
the sumerians were one of the first known beer drinking societies . cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew . they brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat , barley , and mixed grain beers . beer brewing was very important to the sumerians . it was referenced in the epic of gilgamesh when enkidu was introduced to the food and beer of gilgamesh 's people : " drink the beer , as is the custom of the land ... he drank the beer-seven jugs ! and became expansive and sang with joy ! "
of alaska 's 2010 census population figure of 710,231 , 20,429 people , or 2.88 % of the population , did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place . approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan , kodiak , palmer and wasilla . cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau , except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 census ( clover pass , herring cove , ketchikan east , mountain point , north tongass highway , pennock island and saxman east ) , but have not been used since . the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska , both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough , in largely remote areas .
a person 's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain , with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity . a definition of pain widely employed in nursing , emphasizing its subjective nature and the importance of believing patient reports , was introduced by margo mccaffery in 1968 : " pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is , existing whenever he says it does " . to assess intensity , the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 , with 0 being no pain at all , and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt . quality can be established by having the patient complete the mcgill pain questionnaire indicating which words best describe their pain .
shell sold 9.5 % of its 23.1 % stake in woodside petroleum in june 2014 and advised that it had reached an agreement for woodside to buy back 9.5 % of its shares at a later stage . shell became a major shareholder in woodside after a 2001 takeover attempt was blocked by then federal treasurer peter costello and the corporation has been open about its intention to sell its stake in woodside as part of its target to shed assets . at a general body meeting , held on 1 august 2014 , 72 percent of shareholders voted to approve the buy-back , short of the 75 percent vote that was required for approval . a statement from shell read : " royal dutch shell acknowledges the outcome of woodside petroleum limited 's shareholders ' negative vote on the selective buy-back proposal . shell is reviewing its options in relation to its remaining 13.6 percent holding . "
the psychoacoustic masking codec was first proposed in 1979 , apparently independently , by manfred r. schroeder , et al . from bell telephone laboratories , inc. in murray hill , nj , and m. a. krasner both in the united states . krasner was the first to publish and to produce hardware for speech ( not usable as music bit compression ) , but the publication of his results as a relatively obscure lincoln laboratory technical report did not immediately influence the mainstream of psychoacoustic codec development . manfred schroeder was already a well-known and revered figure in the worldwide community of acoustical and electrical engineers , but his paper was not much noticed , since it described negative results due to the particular nature of speech and the linear predictive coding ( lpc ) gain present in speech . both krasner and schroeder built upon the work performed by eberhard f. zwicker in the areas of tuning and masking of critical bands , that in turn built on the fundamental research in the area from bell labs of harvey fletcher and his collaborators . a wide variety of ( mostly perceptual ) audio compression algorithms were reported in ieee 's refereed journal on selected areas in communications . that journal reported in february 1988 on a wide range of established , working audio bit compression technologies , some of them using auditory masking as part of their fundamental design , and several showing real-time hardware implementations .
the members of the city council are each elected from single member districts within the city . the mayor and city attorney are elected directly by the voters of the entire city . the mayor , city attorney , and council members are elected to four-year terms , with a two-term limit . elections are held on a non-partisan basis per california state law ; nevertheless , most officeholders do identify themselves as either democrats or republicans . in 2007 , registered democrats outnumbered republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city , and democrats currently ( as of 2015 [ update ] ) hold a 5-4 majority in the city council . the current mayor , kevin faulconer , is a republican .
in 1981 , the times and the sunday times were bought from thomson by rupert murdoch 's news international . the acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators , john collier and bill o'neill .
old english developed from a set of anglo-frisian or north sea germanic dialects originally spoken by germanic tribes traditionally known as the angles , saxons , and jutes . as the anglo-saxons became dominant in england , their language replaced the languages of roman britain : common brittonic , a celtic language , and latin , brought to britain by roman invasion . old english had four main dialects , associated with particular anglo-saxon kingdoms : mercian , northumbrian , kentish and west saxon . it was west saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later old english period , although the dominant forms of middle and modern english would develop mainly from mercian . the speech of eastern and northern parts of england was subject to strong old norse influence due to scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century .
louis did not leave a son as heir after his death in 1382 . instead , he named as his heir the young prince sigismund of luxemburg , who was 11 years old . the hungarian nobility did not accept his claim , and the result was an internal war . sigismund eventually achieved total control of hungary and established his court in buda and visegrád . both palaces were rebuilt and improved , and were considered the richest of the time in europe . inheriting the throne of bohemia and the holy roman empire , sigismund continued conducting his politics from hungary , but he was kept busy fighting the hussites and the ottoman empire , which was becoming a menace to europe in the beginning of the 15th century .
the edwardian era in the united kingdom is the period spanning the reign of king edward vii up to the end of the first world war , including the years surrounding the sinking of the rms titanic . in the early years of the period , the second boer war in south africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions . the imperial policies of the conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the general election of 1906 the liberals won a huge landslide . the liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the house of lords , which was largely conservative . conflict between the two houses of parliament over the people 's budget led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910 . the general election in january that year returned a hung parliament with the balance of power held by labour and irish nationalist members .
federalism , and other forms of territorially autonomy , is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order prevent violence among different groups with countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the subnational level . some scholars have suggested , however , that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states . still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms tthat encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries .
immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy , however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination . in the case of rotavirus , which was responsible for around 6 % of diarrheal episodes and 20 % of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries , use of a rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight ( 2-3 % ) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence , while reducing overall mortality by 6-10 % . similarly , a cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality , though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease . since this time , more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations , while reducing the overall cost of treatment , and the costs to society .
the performance of " summertime " by barrino , later known simply as " fantasia " , at top 8 was widely praised , and simon cowell considered it as his favorite idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show . fantasia and diana degarmo were the last two finalists , and fantasia was crowned as the winner . fantasia released as her coronation single " i believe " , a song co-written by season one finalist tamyra gray , and degarmo released " dreams " . fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist , while hudson , who placed seventh , became the only idol contestant so far to win both an academy award and a grammy .
there have been six instances as of 2009 in which the exemption process was initiated . of these six , one was granted , one was partially granted , one was denied and three were withdrawn . donald baur , in the endangered species act : law , policy , and perspectives , concluded , " ... the exemption provision is basically a nonfactor in the administration of the esa . a major reason , of course , is that so few consultations result in jeopardy opinions , and those that do almost always result in the identification of reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid jeopardy . "
melatonin is absent from the system or undetectably low during daytime . its onset in dim light , dim-light melatonin onset ( dlmo ) , at roughly 21:00 ( 9 p.m. ) can be measured in the blood or the saliva . its major metabolite can also be measured in morning urine . both dlmo and the midpoint ( in time ) of the presence of the hormone in the blood or saliva have been used as circadian markers . however , newer research indicates that the melatonin offset may be the more reliable marker . benloucif et al . found that melatonin phase markers were more stable and more highly correlated with the timing of sleep than the core temperature minimum . they found that both sleep offset and melatonin offset are more strongly correlated with phase markers than the onset of sleep . in addition , the declining phase of the melatonin levels is more reliable and stable than the termination of melatonin synthesis .
after the civil war , population expansion , railroad construction , and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the great plains . several tribes , especially the sioux and comanche , fiercely resisted confinement to reservations . the main role of the army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other , william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan were in charge . a famous victory for the plains nations was the battle of the little big horn in 1876 , when col. george armstrong custer and two hundred plus members of the 7th cavalry were killed by a force consisting of native americans from the lakota , northern cheyenne , and arapaho nations . the last significant conflict came in 1891 .
between 1631 and 1890 , the city tripled its area through land reclamation by filling in marshes , mud flats , and gaps between wharves along the waterfront . the largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century ; beginning in 1807 , the crown of beacon hill was used to fill in a 50-acre ( 20 ha ) mill pond that later became the haymarket square area . the present-day state house sits atop this lowered beacon hill . reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the south end , the west end , the financial district , and chinatown . after the great boston fire of 1872 , workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront . during the mid-to-late 19th century , workers filled almost 600 acres ( 2.4 km2 ) of brackish charles river marshlands west of boston common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of needham heights . the city annexed the adjacent towns of south boston ( 1804 ) , east boston ( 1836 ) , roxbury ( 1868 ) , dorchester ( including present day mattapan and a portion of south boston ) ( 1870 ) , brighton ( including present day allston ) ( 1874 ) , west roxbury ( including present day jamaica plain and roslindale ) ( 1874 ) , charlestown ( 1874 ) , and hyde park ( 1912 ) . other proposals , for the annexation of brookline , cambridge , and chelsea , were unsuccessful .
in 1933 , the orthodox church of greece officially declared that being a freemason constitutes an act of apostasy and thus , until he repents , the person involved with freemasonry can not partake of the eucharist . this has been generally affirmed throughout the whole eastern orthodox church . the orthodox critique of freemasonry agrees with both the roman catholic and protestant versions : " freemasonry can not be at all compatible with christianity as far as it is a secret organisation , acting and teaching in mystery and secret and deifying rationalism . "
intellectuals such as robert darnton and jürgen habermas have focused on the social conditions of the enlightenment . habermas described the creation of the " bourgeois public sphere " in 18th-century europe , containing the new venues and modes of communication allowing for rational exchange . habermas said that the public sphere was bourgeois , egalitarian , rational , and independent from the state , making it the ideal venue for intellectuals to critically examine contemporary politics and society , away from the interference of established authority . while the public sphere is generally an integral component of the social study of the enlightenment , other historians have questioned whether the public sphere had these characteristics .
montana has been a destination for its world-class trout fisheries since the 1930s . fly fishing for several species of native and introduced trout in rivers and lakes is popular for both residents and tourists throughout the state . montana is the home of the federation of fly fishers and hosts many of the organizations annual conclaves . the state has robust recreational lake trout and kokanee salmon fisheries in the west , walleye can be found in many parts of the state , while northern pike , smallmouth and largemouth bass fisheries as well as catfish and paddlefish can be found in the waters of eastern montana . robert redford 's 1992 film of norman mclean 's novel , a river runs through it , was filmed in montana and brought national attention to fly fishing and the state .
in a fet , the drain-to-source current flows via a conducting channel that connects the source region to the drain region . the conductivity is varied by the electric field that is produced when a voltage is applied between the gate and source terminals ; hence the current flowing between the drain and source is controlled by the voltage applied between the gate and source . as the gate–source voltage ( vgs ) is increased , the drain–source current ( ids ) increases exponentially for vgs below threshold , and then at a roughly quadratic rate ( igs ∝ ( vgs − vt ) 2 ) ( where vt is the threshold voltage at which drain current begins ) in the " space-charge-limited " region above threshold . a quadratic behavior is not observed in modern devices , for example , at the 65 nm technology node .
a different format , cd-4 ( not to be confused with compact disc ) , by rca , encoded the front-rear difference information on an ultrasonic carrier , which required a special wideband cartridge to capture it on carefully calibrated pickup arm/turntable combinations . cd-4 was even less successful than the two matrixed formats . ( a further problem was that no cutting heads were available that could handle the hf information . that was remedied by cutting at half the speed . later , the special half-speed cutting heads and equalization techniques were employed to get a wider frequency response in stereo with reduced distortion and greater headroom . )
the concept 's origins can potentially be traced back further . jewish law includes several considerations whose effects are similar to those of modern intellectual property laws , though the notion of intellectual creations as property does not seem to exist – notably the principle of hasagat ge'vul ( unfair encroachment ) was used to justify limited-term publisher ( but not author ) copyright in the 16th century . in 500 bce , the government of the greek state of sybaris offered one year 's patent " to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury " .
modern examples particularly include chinese characters for si units . in chinese these units are disyllabic and standardly written with two characters , as 厘米 límǐ " centimeter " ( 厘 centi- , 米 meter ) or 千瓦 qiānwǎ " kilowatt " . however , in the 19th century these were often written via compound characters , pronounced disyllabically , such as 瓩 for 千瓦 or 糎 for 厘米 – some of these characters were also used in japan , where they were pronounced with borrowed european readings instead . these have now fallen out of general use , but are occasionally seen . less systematic examples include 圕 túshūguǎn " library " , a contraction of 圖書館 , a four-morpheme word , 社会主义 shèhuì zhǔyì " socialism " , is commonly written with a single character formed by combining the last character , 义 , with the radical of the first , 社 , yielding roughly 礻义 .
adams sent condolences to donda west 's family but declined to publicly discuss the procedure , citing confidentiality . west ’ s family , through celebrity attorney ed mcpherson , filed complaints with the medical board against adams and aboolian for violating patient confidentiality following her death . adams had previously been under scrutiny by the medical board . he appeared on larry king live on november 20 , 2007 , but left before speaking . two days later , he appeared again , with his attorney , stating he was there to " defend himself " . he said that the recently released autopsy results " spoke for themselves " . the final coroner 's report january 10 , 2008 , concluded that donda west died of " coronary artery disease and multiple post-operative factors due to or as a consequence of liposuction and mammoplasty " .
bond and swann return to london where they meet m , bill tanner , q , and moneypenny ; they intend to arrest c and stop nine eyes from going online . swann leaves bond , telling him she can not be part of a life involving espionage , and is subsequently kidnapped . on the way , the group is ambushed and bond is kidnapped , but the rest still proceed with the plan . after q succeeds in preventing the nine eyes from going online , a brief struggle between m and c ends with the latter falling to his death . meanwhile , bond is taken to the old mi6 building , which is scheduled for demolition , and frees himself . moving throughout the ruined labyrinth , he encounters a disfigured blofeld , who tells him that he has three minutes to escape the building before explosives are detonated or die trying to save swann . bond finds swann and the two escape by boat as the building collapses . bond shoots down blofeld 's helicopter , which crashes onto westminster bridge . as blofeld crawls away from the wreckage , bond confronts him but ultimately leaves him to be arrested by m. bond leaves the bridge with swann .
the germanic superstrate has had different outcomes in spanish and catalan . for example , catalan fang " mud " and rostir " to roast " , of germanic origin , contrast with spanish lodo and asar , of latin origin ; whereas catalan filosa " spinning wheel " and pols " temple " , of latin origin , contrast with spanish rueca and sien , of germanic origin .
british colonial rule introduced western elements of culture to burma . burma 's education system is modelled after that of the united kingdom . colonial architectural influences are most evident in major cities such as yangon . many ethnic minorities , particularly the karen in the southeast and the kachin and chin who populate the north and northeast , practice christianity . according to the the world factbook , the burman population is 68 % and the ethnic groups constitute 32 % . however , the exiled leaders and organisations claims that ethnic population is 40 % , which is implicitly contrasted with cia report ( official us report ) .
the first newspaper in namibia was the german-language windhoeker anzeiger , founded 1898 . radio was introduced in 1969 , tv in 1981 . during german rule , the newspapers mainly reflected the living reality and the view of the white german-speaking minority . the black majority was ignored or depicted as a threat . during south african rule , the white bias continued , with mentionable influence of the pretoria government on the " south west african " media system . independent newspapers were seen as a menace to the existing order , critical journalists threatened .
following the successes of his trial-run games , foster moved ahead with his idea for arena football . he founded the arena football league with four teams : the pittsburgh gladiators , denver dynamite , washington commandos , and chicago bruisers . foster appointed legendary darrel " mouse " davis , godfather of the " run and shoot " and modern pro offenses , as executive director of football operations . davis hired the original coaches and was the architect of the league 's original wide-open offensive playbooks .
in november 1795 , there was a debate in parliament on the high price of corn and burke wrote a memorandum to pitt on the subject . in december samuel whitbread mp introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and fox said he would vote for it . this debate probably led burke to editing his memorandum , as there appeared a notice that burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the secretary of the board of agriculture , arthur young ; but he failed to complete it . these fragments were inserted into the memorandum after his death and published posthumously in 1800 as , thoughts and details on scarcity . in it , burke expounded " some of the doctrines of political economists bearing upon agriculture as a trade " . burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages , and set out what the limits of government should be :
genetic studies of mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of amerindians and some siberian and central asian peoples also revealed that the gene pool of the turkic-speaking peoples of siberia such as altaians , khakas , shors and soyots , living between the altai and lake baikal along the sayan mountains , are genetically closest to amerindians . [ citation needed ] this view is shared by other researchers who argue that " the ancestors of the american indians were the first to separate from the great asian population in the middle paleolithic . 2012 research found evidence for a recent common ancestry between native americans and indigenous altaians based on mitochondrial dna and y-chromosome analysis . the paternal lineages of altaians mostly belong to the subclades of haplogroup p-m45 ( xr1a 38-93 % ; xq1a 4-32 % ) .
southampton is home to southampton football club—nicknamed " the saints " —who play in the premier league at st mary 's stadium , having relocated in 2001 from their 103-year-old former stadium , " the dell " . they reached the top flight of english football ( first division ) for the first time in 1966 , staying there for eight years . they lifted the fa cup with a shock victory over manchester united in 1976 , returned to the top flight two years later , and stayed there for 27 years ( becoming founder members of the premier league in 1992 ) before they were relegated in 2005 . the club was promoted back to the premier league in 2012 following a brief spell in the third-tier and severe financial difficulties . in 2015 , " the saints " finished 7th in the premier league , their highest league finish in 30 years , after a remarkable season under new manager ronald koeman . their highest league position came in 1984 when they were runners-up in the old first division . they were also runners-up in the 1979 football league cup final and 2003 fa cup final . notable former managers include ted bates , lawrie mcmenemy , chris nicholl , ian branfoot and gordon strachan . there is a strong rivalry between portsmouth f.c . ( " south coast derby " ) which is located only about 30 km ( 19 mi ) away .
over the course of ottoman history , the ottomans managed to build a large collection of libraries complete with translations of books from other cultures , as well as original manuscripts . a great part of this desire for local and foreign manuscripts arose in the 15th century . sultan mehmet ii ordered georgios amiroutzes , a greek scholar from trabzon , to translate and make available to ottoman educational institutions the geography book of ptolemy . another example is ali qushji -an astronomer , mathematician and physicist originally from samarkand- who became a professor in two madrasas , and influenced ottoman circles as a result of his writings and the activities of his students , even though he only spent two or three years before his death in istanbul .
when the book was released , reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts , and opinion was mixed about lee 's ability to connect them . the first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood . reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jem 's observations of their quirky neighbors . one writer was so impressed by lee 's detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism . this sentimentalism can be seen in lee 's representation of the southern caste system to explain almost every character 's behavior in the novel . scout 's aunt alexandra attributes maycomb 's inhabitants ' faults and advantages to genealogy ( families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks ) , and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the finch family history and the history of maycomb . this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson , and scout 's definition of " fine folks " being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have . the south itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters .
an electrostatic motor is based on the attraction and repulsion of electric charge . usually , electrostatic motors are the dual of conventional coil-based motors . they typically require a high-voltage power supply , although very small motors employ lower voltages . conventional electric motors instead employ magnetic attraction and repulsion , and require high current at low voltages . in the 1750s , the first electrostatic motors were developed by benjamin franklin and andrew gordon . today the electrostatic motor finds frequent use in micro-electro-mechanical systems ( mems ) where their drive voltages are below 100 volts , and where moving , charged plates are far easier to fabricate than coils and iron cores . also , the molecular machinery which runs living cells is often based on linear and rotary electrostatic motors .

in the mid-16th century , " botanical gardens " were founded in a number of italian universities – the padua botanical garden in 1545 is usually considered to be the first which is still in its original location . these gardens continued the practical value of earlier " physic gardens " , often associated with monasteries , in which plants were cultivated for medical use . they supported the growth of botany as an academic subject . lectures were given about the plants grown in the gardens and their medical uses demonstrated . botanical gardens came much later to northern europe ; the first in england was the university of oxford botanic garden in 1621 . throughout this period , botany remained firmly subordinate to medicine .
marvel held its own comic book convention , marvelcon '75 , in spring 1975 , and promised a marvelcon '76 . at the 1975 event , stan lee used a fantastic four panel discussion to announce that jack kirby , the artist co-creator of most of marvel 's signature characters , was returning to marvel after having left in 1970 to work for rival dc comics . in october 1976 , marvel , which already licensed reprints in different countries , including the uk , created a superhero specifically for the british market . captain britain debuted exclusively in the uk , and later appeared in american comics .
established in 1591 by muhammad quli qutb shah , hyderabad remained under the rule of the qutb shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the mughals captured the region . in 1724 , mughal viceroy asif jah i declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty , known as the nizams of hyderabad . the nizam 's dominions became a princely state during the british raj , and remained so for 150 years , with the city serving as its capital . the nizami influence can still be seen in the culture of the hyderabadi muslims . the city continued as the capital of hyderabad state after it was brought into the indian union in 1948 , and became the capital of andhra pradesh after the states reorganisation act , 1956 . since 1956 , rashtrapati nilayam in the city has been the winter office of the president of india . in 2014 , the newly formed state of telangana split from andhra pradesh and the city became joint capital of the two states , a transitional arrangement scheduled to end by 2025 .
russia feared losing russian america without compensation in some future conflict , especially to the british . while alaska attracted little interest at the time , the population of nearby british columbia started to increase rapidly a few years after hostilities ended . therefore , the russian emperor , alexander ii , decided to sell alaska . in 1859 the russians offered to sell the territory to the united states , hoping that its presence in the region would offset the plans of russia 's greatest regional rival , the united kingdom .
symbiosis played a major role in the co-evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them . many plants that are pollinated by insects , bats , or birds have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is also correspondingly adapted . the first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers . adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants , and , at the same time , corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups . some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen , while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources . in some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent , where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect .
the times literary supplement ( tls ) first appeared in 1902 as a supplement to the times , becoming a separately paid-for weekly literature and society magazine in 1914 . the times and the tls have continued to be co-owned , and as of 2012 the tls is also published by news international and cooperates closely with the times , with its online version hosted on the times website , and its editorial offices based in times house , pennington street , london .
it is common to classify wood as either softwood or hardwood . the wood from conifers ( e.g . pine ) is called softwood , and the wood from dicotyledons ( usually broad-leaved trees , e.g . oak ) is called hardwood . these names are a bit misleading , as hardwoods are not necessarily hard , and softwoods are not necessarily soft . the well-known balsa ( a hardwood ) is actually softer than any commercial softwood . conversely , some softwoods ( e.g . yew ) are harder than many hardwoods .
archaeologists excavating near the city have unearthed iron age sites that may date from 500 bce . the region comprising modern hyderabad and its surroundings was known as golkonda ( golla konda- " shepherd 's hill " ) , and was ruled by the chalukya dynasty from 624 ce to 1075 ce . following the dissolution of the chalukya empire into four parts in the 11th century , golkonda came under the control of the kakatiya dynasty from 1158 , whose seat of power was at warangal , 148 km ( 92 mi ) northeast of modern hyderabad .
the ming dynasty granted titles to lamas of schools such as the karmapa kargyu , but the latter had previously declined mongol invitations to receive titles . when the ming yongle emperor invited je tsongkhapa ( 1357–1419 ) , founder of the gelug school , to come to the ming court and pay tribute , the latter declined . wang and nyima write that this was due to old age and physical weakness , and also because of efforts being made to build three major monasteries . chen qingying states that tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the emperor 's invitation , and in this reply , tsongkhapa wrote :
major sporting venues in new delhi include the jawaharlal nehru stadium , ambedkar stadium , indira gandhi indoor stadium , feroz shah kotla ground , r.k. khanna tennis complex , dhyan chand national stadium and siri fort sports complex .
emotions involve different components , such as subjective experience , cognitive processes , expressive behavior , psychophysiological changes , and instrumental behavior . at one time , academics attempted to identify the emotion with one of the components : william james with a subjective experience , behaviorists with instrumental behavior , psychophysiologists with physiological changes , and so on . more recently , emotion is said to consist of all the components . the different components of emotion are categorized somewhat differently depending on the academic discipline . in psychology and philosophy , emotion typically includes a subjective , conscious experience characterized primarily by psychophysiological expressions , biological reactions , and mental states . a similar multicomponential description of emotion is found in sociology . for example , peggy thoits described emotions as involving physiological components , cultural or emotional labels ( e.g. , anger , surprise etc . ) , expressive body actions , and the appraisal of situations and contexts .
gaddafi briefly studied history at the university of libya in benghazi , before dropping out to join the military . despite his police record , in 1963 he began training at the royal military academy , benghazi , alongside several like-minded friends from misrata . the armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged libyans , and gaddafi recognised it as a potential instrument of political change . under idris , libya 's armed forces were trained by the british military ; this angered gaddafi , who viewed the british as imperialists , and accordingly he refused to learn english and was rude to the british officers , ultimately failing his exams . british trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour , stating their suspicion that he was involved in the assassination of the military academy 's commander in 1963 . such reports were ignored and gaddafi quickly progressed through the course .
in these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school 's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment . a problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area . in the selective school system , which survives in several parts of the united kingdom , admission is dependent on selection criteria , most commonly a cognitive test or tests . although comprehensive schools were introduced to england and wales in 1965 , there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation . [ citation needed ] ( though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in england ) . most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16 , but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools , and in some places the secondary level is divided into two , for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18 , roughly corresponding to the us middle school ( or junior high school ) and high school , respectively . with the advent of key stages in the national curriculum some local authorities reverted from the middle school system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another .
domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors , such as bite inhibition , from their wolf ancestors , which would have been pack hunters with complex body language . these sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability , playfulness , and ability to fit into human households and social situations , and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today . : pages95-136
the first commutator dc electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the british scientist william sturgeon in 1832 . following sturgeon 's work , a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made with the intention of commercial use was built by the american inventor thomas davenport , which he patented in 1837 . the motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute , and powered machine tools and a printing press . due to the high cost of primary battery power , the motors were commercially unsuccessful and davenport went bankrupt . several inventors followed sturgeon in the development of dc motors but all encountered the same battery power cost issues . no electricity distribution had been developed at the time . like sturgeon 's motor , there was no practical commercial market for these motors .
the largest cemetery is the cementerio del norte , located in the northern-central part of the city . the central cemetery ( spanish : cementerio central ) , located in barrio sur in the southern area of the city , is one of uruguay 's main cemeteries . it was one of the first cemeteries ( in contrast to church graveyards ) in the country , founded in 1835 in a time where burials were still carried out by the catholic church . it is the burial place of many of the most famous uruguayans , such as eduardo acevedo , delmira agustini , luis batlle berres , josé batlle y ordóñez , juan manuel blanes , françois ducasse , father of comte de lautréamont ( isidore ducasse ) , luis alberto de herrera , benito nardone , josé enrique rodó , and juan zorrilla de san martín .
john knox ( 1505–1572 ) , a scot who had spent time studying under calvin in geneva , returned to scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the church in line with calvinist doctrines . after a period of religious convulsion and political conflict culminating in a victory for the protestant party at the siege of leith the authority of the church of rome was abolished in favour of reformation by the legislation of the scottish reformation parliament in 1560 . the church was eventually organised by andrew melville along presbyterian lines to become the national church of scotland . king james vi and i moved the church of scotland towards an episcopal form of government , and in 1637 , james ' successor , charles i and william laud , the archbishop of canterbury , attempted to force the church of scotland to use the book of common prayer . what resulted was an armed insurrection , with many scots signing the solemn league and covenant . the covenanters would serve as the government of scotland for nearly a decade , and would also send military support to the parliamentarians during the english civil war . following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , charles ii , despite the initial support that he received from the covenanters , reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church .
adolescents tend to associate with " cliques " on a small scale and " crowds " on a larger scale . during early adolescence , adolescents often associate in cliques , exclusive , single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close . despite the common notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence , they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity . within a clique of highly athletic male-peers , for example , the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition . cliques also have become somewhat a " collective parent , " i.e . telling the adolescents what to do and not to do . towards late adolescence , cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another . these small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented . on a larger scale , adolescents often associate with crowds , groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity . often , crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people , such as jocks or nerds . in large , multi-ethnic high schools , there are often ethnically-determined crowds . while crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence , they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually .
hayek was concerned about the general view in britain 's academia that fascism was a capitalist reaction to socialism and the road to serfdom arose from those concerns . it was written between 1940 and 1943 . the title was inspired by the french classical liberal thinker alexis de tocqueville 's writings on the " road to servitude . " it was first published in britain by routledge in march 1944 and was quite popular , leading hayek to call it " that unobtainable book , " also due in part to wartime paper rationing . when it was published in the united states by the university of chicago in september of that year , it achieved greater popularity than in britain . at the arrangement of editor max eastman , the american magazine reader 's digest also published an abridged version in april 1945 , enabling the road to serfdom to reach a far wider audience than academics . the book is widely popular among those advocating individualism and classical liberalism .
modern adult contemporary can be a variation of hot ac , and includes modern rock titles in its presentation . in 1997 , mike marino of kmxb in las vegas described the format as reaching " an audience that has outgrown the edgier hip-hop or alternative music but has n't gotten old and sappy enough for the soft acs . " the format 's artists included alanis morissette , counting crows , gin blossoms , bon jovi , train , no doubt , the script , the cranberries , lifehouse , sarah mclachlan , sara bareilles , john mayer , jewel , and ingrid michaelson . unlike modern rock , which went after 18-34 men , this format appealed to women .
the arthashastra and the edicts of ashoka are the primary written records of the mauryan times . archaeologically , this period falls into the era of northern black polished ware ( nbpw ) . the mauryan empire was based on a modern and efficient economy and society . however , the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government . although there was no banking in the mauryan society , usury was customary . a significant amount of written records on slavery are found , suggesting a prevalence thereof . during this period , a high quality steel called wootz steel was developed in south india and was later exported to china and arabia .
in the constituent legislature or convention , the conservative and liberal elements formed using the nicknames of chirrines and cuchas . the military entered as a third party . the elections for the first regular legislature were disputed , and it was not until may 1 , 1826 , that the body was installed . the liberals gained control and the opposition responded by fomenting a conspiracy . this was promptly stopped with the aid of informers , and more strenuous measures were taken against the conservatives . extra powers were conferred on the durango governor , santiago baca ortiz , deputy to the first national congress , and leader of the liberal party .
the development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops [ aa ] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system , with a consequent increase in production . the development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently , aided by the spread of the horse collar , which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen . horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture , factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system .
ozawa 's " northern force " had four aircraft carriers , two obsolete battleships partly converted to carriers , three cruisers and nine destroyers . the carriers had only 108 planes . the force was not spotted by the allies until 16:40 on 24 october . at 20:00 toyoda ordered all remaining japanese forces to attack . halsey saw an opportunity to destroy the remnants of the japanese carrier force . the u.s. third fleet was formidable – nine large carriers , eight light carriers , six battleships , 17 cruisers , 63 destroyers and 1,000 planes – and completely outgunned ozawa 's force . halsey 's ships set out in pursuit of ozawa just after midnight . u.s. commanders ignored reports that kurita had turned back towards san bernardino strait . they had taken the bait set by ozawa . on the morning of 25 october ozawa launched 75 planes . most were shot down by u.s. fighter patrols . by 08:00 u.s. fighters had destroyed the screen of japanese fighters and were hitting ships . by evening , they had sunk the carriers zuikaku , zuihō , and chiyoda , and a destroyer . the fourth carrier , chitose , and a cruiser were disabled and later sank .

since the late 18th century , sanskrit has been transliterated using the latin alphabet . the system most commonly used today is the iast ( international alphabet of sanskrit transliteration ) , which has been the academic standard since 1888 . ascii-based transliteration schemes have also evolved because of difficulties representing sanskrit characters in computer systems . these include harvard-kyoto and itrans , a transliteration scheme that is used widely on the internet , especially in usenet and in email , for considerations of speed of entry as well as rendering issues . with the wide availability of unicode-aware web browsers , iast has become common online . it is also possible to type using an alphanumeric keyboard and transliterate to devanagari using software like mac os x 's international support .
in april 2008 , a £90m contract was signed with boeing for a " quick fix " solution , so they can fly by 2010 : qinetiq will downgrade the chinooks—stripping out some of their more advanced equipment .
religious knowledge or " vision " was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside of the buddhist fold . according to the samaññaphala sutta , this sort of vision arose for the buddhist adept as a result of the perfection of " meditation " coupled with the perfection of " discipline " ( pali sīla ; skt . śīla ) . some of the buddha 's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day , but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of " transcendent wisdom " ( pali paññā ; skt . prajñā ) was original .

conventional ( " tailhook " ) aircraft rely upon a landing signal officer ( lso , radio call sign paddles ) to monitor the aircraft 's approach , visually gauge glideslope , attitude , and airspeed , and transmit that data to the pilot . before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s , lsos used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot ( hence the nickname ) . from the late 1950s onward , visual landing aids such as optical landing system have provided information on proper glide slope , but lsos still transmit voice calls to approaching pilots by radio .
iranian cuisine is diverse due to its variety of ethnic groups and the influence of other cultures . herbs are frequently used along with fruits such as plums , pomegranates , quince , prunes , apricots , and raisins . iranians usually eat plain yogurt with lunch and dinner ; it is a staple of the diet in iran . to achieve a balanced taste , characteristic flavourings such as saffron , dried limes , cinnamon , and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes . onions and garlic are normally used in the preparation of the accompanying course , but are also served separately during meals , either in raw or pickled form . iran is also famous for its caviar .
the final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology , known collectively as cognitive science . cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation , using the tools of psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , and neurobiology . new methods of visualizing the activity of the brain , such as pet scans and cat scans , began to exert their influence as well , leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain , rather than cognition . these new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible , and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains , such as artificial intelligence .
the mp3 lossy audio data compression algorithm takes advantage of a perceptual limitation of human hearing called auditory masking . in 1894 , the american physicist alfred m. mayer reported that a tone could be rendered inaudible by another tone of lower frequency . in 1959 , richard ehmer described a complete set of auditory curves regarding this phenomenon . ernst terhardt et al . created an algorithm describing auditory masking with high accuracy . this work added to a variety of reports from authors dating back to fletcher , and to the work that initially determined critical ratios and critical bandwidths .
in arabia , bahrain , which was referred to by the greeks as tylos , the centre of pearl trading , when nearchus came to discover it serving under alexander the great . the greek admiral nearchus is believed to have been the first of alexander 's commanders to visit these islands . it is not known whether bahrain was part of the seleucid empire , although the archaeological site at qalat al bahrain has been proposed as a seleucid base in the persian gulf . alexander had planned to settle the eastern shores of the persian gulf with greek colonists , and although it is not clear that this happened on the scale he envisaged , tylos was very much part of the hellenised world : the language of the upper classes was greek ( although aramaic was in everyday use ) , while zeus was worshipped in the form of the arabian sun-god shams . tylos even became the site of greek athletic contests .
even so , the decision by okl to support the strategy in directive 23 was instigated by two considerations , both of which had little to do with wanting to destroy britain 's sea communications in conjunction with the kriegsmarine . first , the difficulty in estimating the impact of bombing upon war production was becoming apparent , and second , the conclusion british morale was unlikely to break led okl to adopt the naval option . the indifference displayed by okl to directive 23 was perhaps best demonstrated in operational directives which diluted its effect . they emphasised the core strategic interest was attacking ports but they insisted in maintaining pressure , or diverting strength , onto industries building aircraft , anti-aircraft guns , and explosives . other targets would be considered if the primary ones could not be attacked because of weather conditions .
the word " insect " comes from the latin word insectum , meaning " with a notched or divided body " , or literally " cut into " , from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare , " to cut into , to cut up " , from in- " into " and secare " to cut " ; because insects appear " cut into " three sections . pliny the elder introduced the latin designation as a loan-translation of the greek word ἔντομος ( éntomos ) or " insect " ( as in entomology ) , which was aristotle 's term for this class of life , also in reference to their " notched " bodies . " insect " first appears documented in english in 1601 in holland 's translation of pliny . translations of aristotle 's term also form the usual word for " insect " in welsh ( trychfil , from trychu " to cut " and mil , " animal " ) , serbo-croatian ( zareznik , from rezati , " to cut " ) , russian ( насекомое nasekomoje , from seč'/-sekat ' , " to cut " ) , etc .
the main local and regional bus station of utrecht is located adjacent to utrecht centraal railway station , at the east and west entrances . due to large scale renovation and construction works at the railway station , the station 's bus stops are changing frequently . as a general rule , westbound buses depart from the bus station on the west entrance , other buses from the east side station . local buses in utrecht are operated by qbuzz – its services include a high-frequency service to the uithof university district . the local bus fleet is one of europe 's cleanest , using only buses compliant with the euro-vi standard as well as electric buses for inner city transport . regional buses from the city are operated by arriva and connexxion .
the major applications of copper are in electrical wires ( 60 % ) , roofing and plumbing ( 20 % ) and industrial machinery ( 15 % ) . copper is mostly used as a pure metal , but when a higher hardness is required it is combined with other elements to make an alloy ( 5 % of total use ) such as brass and bronze . a small part of copper supply is used in production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture . machining of copper is possible , although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics .
on the french side , planning after the disaster at wissembourg had become essential . general le bœuf , flushed with anger , was intent upon going on the offensive over the saar and countering their loss . however , planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride , as intendant general wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the saar would be impossible . therefore , the armies of france would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible attack point , but also left the armies unable to support each other .
his book of healing became available in europe in partial latin translation some fifty years after its composition , under the title sufficientia , and some authors have identified a " latin avicennism " as flourishing for some time , paralleling the more influential latin averroism , but suppressed by the parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215 . avicenna 's psychology and theory of knowledge influenced william of auvergne , bishop of paris and albertus magnus , while his metaphysics had an impact on the thought of thomas aquinas .
according to the 2010 revison of the un world population prospects , guinea-bissau 's population was 1,515,000 in 2010 , compared to 518,000 in 1950 . the proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 41.3 % , 55.4 % were aged between 15 and 65 years of age , while 3.3 % were aged 65 years or older .
while a few fragments exist , there is no surviving historical work which dates to the hundred years following alexander 's death . the works of the major hellenistic historians hieronymus of cardia ( who worked under alexander , antigonus i and other successors ) , duris of samos and phylarchus which were used by surviving sources are all lost . the earliest and most credible surviving source for the hellenistic period is polybius of megalopolis ( c. 200-118 ) , a statesman of the achaean league until 168 bce when he was forced to go to rome as a hostage . his histories eventually grew to a length of forty books , covering the years 220 to 167 bce .
in some cases a wrestler may possess admirable physical traits but perceived mediocre public speaking abilities ( such as brock lesnar ) , or their gimmick may be that of a " wild savage " needing a handler ( such as kamala ) . such performers have historically employed a manager , who speaks on their behalf and adds to the performance . managers have sometimes become major personalities , including bobby heenan , paul heyman , ernie roth , and paul bearer . a manager role may also be filled by a " valet " , typically an appealing female who may participate in love triangle storylines , " damsel in distress " situations , and scripted fights with female wrestlers . some of these have also gone on to become recognized stars , such as tammy lynn sytch , stacy keibler , and miss elizabeth .
the inventor nicéphore niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in paris in 1825 , and then developed the process with louis daguerre . the work of étienne-jules marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography . photography came to occupy a central role in parisian surrealist activity , in the works of man ray and maurice tabard . numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of paris , including eugène atget , noted for his depictions of street scenes , robert doisneau , noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes ( among which le baiser de l'hôtel de ville has became iconic of the romantic vision of paris ) , marcel bovis , noted for his night scenes , and others such as jacques-henri lartigue and cartier-bresson . poster art also became an important art form in paris in the late nineteenth century , through the work of henri de toulouse-lautrec , jules chéret , eugène grasset , adolphe willette , pierre bonnard , georges de feure , henri-gabriel ibels , gavarni , and alphonse mucha .
cairo university is ranked as 401-500 according to the academic ranking of world universities ( shanghai ranking ) and 551-600 according to qs world university rankings . american university in cairo is ranked as 360 according to qs world university rankings and al-azhar university , alexandria university and ain shams university fall in the 701+ range . egypt is currently opening new research institutes for the aim of modernising research in the nation , the most recent example of which is zewail city of science and technology .
his relationship with palestinian leader yasser arafat of fatah was strained , with gaddafi considering him too moderate and calling for more violent action . instead he supported militia like the popular front for the liberation of palestine , popular front for the liberation of palestine – general command , the democratic front for the liberation of palestine , as-sa'iqa , the palestinian popular struggle front , and the abu nidal organization . he funded the black september organization who perpetrated the 1972 munich massacre of israeli athletes in west germany , and had the killed militants ' bodies flown to libya for a hero 's funeral . gaddafi also welcomed the three surviving attackers in tripoli following their release in exchange for the hostages of hijacked lufthansa flight 615 a few weeks later and allowed them to go into hiding .
in the 1970s , job losses due to industrial restructuring caused new york city to suffer from economic problems and rising crime rates . while a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city 's economic health in the 1980s , new york 's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s . by the mid 1990s , crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies , improving economic opportunities , gentrification , and new residents , both american transplants and new immigrants from asia and latin america . important new sectors , such as silicon alley , emerged in the city 's economy . new york 's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 census and then again in the 2010 census .
feynman had a great deal of success teaching carl , using , for example , discussions about ants and martians as a device for gaining perspective on problems and issues . he was surprised to learn that the same teaching devices were not useful with michelle . mathematics was a common interest for father and son ; they both entered the computer field as consultants and were involved in advancing a new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problems—later known as parallel computing . the jet propulsion laboratory retained feynman as a computational consultant during critical missions . one co-worker characterized feynman as akin to don quixote at his desk , rather than at a computer workstation , ready to do battle with the windmills .
they can also be armed with non-lethal ( more accurately known as " less than lethal " or " less-lethal " ) weaponry , particularly for riot control . non-lethal weapons include batons , tear gas , riot control agents , rubber bullets , riot shields , water cannons and electroshock weapons . police officers often carry handcuffs to restrain suspects . the use of firearms or deadly force is typically a last resort only to be used when necessary to save human life , although some jurisdictions ( such as brazil ) allow its use against fleeing felons and escaped convicts . a " shoot-to-kill " policy was recently introduced in south africa , which allows police to use deadly force against any person who poses a significant threat to them or civilians . with the country having one of the highest rates of violent crime , president jacob zuma states that south africa needs to handle crime differently from other countries .
georgian succeeded the english baroque of sir christopher wren , sir john vanbrugh , thomas archer , william talman , and nicholas hawksmoor ; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s , overlapping with a more restrained georgian style . the architect james gibbs was a transitional figure , his earlier buildings are baroque , reflecting the time he spent in rome in the early 18th century , but he adjusted his style after 1720 . major architects to promote the change in direction from baroque were colen campbell , author of the influential book vitruvius britannicus ( 1715-1725 ) ; richard boyle , 3rd earl of burlington and his protégé william kent ; isaac ware ; henry flitcroft and the venetian giacomo leoni , who spent most of his career in england . other prominent architects of the early georgian period include james paine , robert taylor , and john wood , the elder . the european grand tour became very common for wealthy patrons in the period , and italian influence remained dominant , though at the start of the period hanover square , westminster ( 1713 on ) , developed and occupied by whig supporters of the new dynasty , seems to have deliberately adopted german stylisic elements in their honour , especially vertical bands connecting the windows .
as the 20th century came to a close , gaddafi increasingly rejected arab nationalism , frustrated by the failure of his pan-arab ideals ; instead he turned to pan-africanism , emphasising libya 's african identity . from 1997 to 2000 , libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 african states , and in 1999 joined the community of sahel-saharan states . in june 1999 , gaddafi visited mandela in south africa , and the following month attended the oau summit in algiers , calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a united states of africa . he became one of the founders of the african union ( au ) , initiated in july 2002 to replace the oau ; at the opening ceremonies , he proclaimed that african states should reject conditional aid from the developed world , a direct contrast to the message of south african president thabo mbeki . at the third au summit , held in libya in july 2005 , he called for a greater level of integration , advocating a single au passport , a common defence system and a single currency , utilising the slogan : " the united states of africa is the hope . " in june 2005 , libya joined the common market for eastern and southern africa ( comesa ) , and in august 2008 gaddafi was proclaimed " king of kings " by an assembled committee of traditional african leaders . on 1 february 2009 , his " coronation ceremony " was held in addis ababa , ethiopia , coinciding with gaddafi 's election as au chairman for a year .
western catalan comprises the two dialects of northwestern catalan and valencian ; the eastern block comprises four dialects : central catalan , balearic , rossellonese , and alguerese . each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects .
there are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion . he did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory , if prophecy could be questioned , and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly , without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers .
arsenal finished in either first or second place in the league in eight of wenger 's first eleven seasons at the club , although on no occasion were they able to retain the title . as of july 2013 , they were one of only five teams , the others being manchester united , blackburn rovers , chelsea , and manchester city , to have won the premier league since its formation in 1992 . arsenal had never progressed beyond the quarter-finals of the champions league until 2005–06 ; in that season they became the first club from london in the competition 's fifty-year history to reach the final , in which they were beaten 2–1 by barcelona . in july 2006 , they moved into the emirates stadium , after 93 years at highbury .
after a three-year hiatus , a fifth digimon series began airing on april 2 , 2006 . like frontier , savers has no connection with the previous installments , and also marks a new start for the digimon franchise , with a drastic change in character designs and story-line , in order to reach a broader audience . the story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of d.a.t.s . ( " digital accident tactics squad " ) , an organization created to conceal the existence of the digital world and digimon from the rest of mankind , and secretly solve any digimon-related incidents occurring on earth . later the d.a.t.s . is dragged into a massive conflict between earth and the digital world , triggered by an ambitious human scientist named akihiro kurata , determined to make use of the digimon for his own personal gains . the english version was dubbed by studiopolis and it premiered on the jetix block on toon disney on october 1 , 2007 . digivolution in data squad requires the human partner 's dna ( " digital natural ability " in the english version and " digisoul " in the japanese version ) to activate , a strong empathy with their digimon and a will to succeed . 'digimon savers ' also introduces a new form of digivolving called burst mode which is essentially the level above mega ( previously the strongest form a digimon could take ) . like previously in tamers , this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed , originally in japan , at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21 . because of that , along with the designs , the anime being heavily edited and localized for western us audiences like past series , and the english dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower tv-y7-fv rating just like past dubs , studiopolis dubbed the anime on jetix with far more edits , changes , censorship , and cut footage . this included giving the japanese characters full americanized names and american surnames as well as applying far more americanization ( marcus damon as opposed to the japanese daimon masaru ) , cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4kids often made ( such as removal of japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining ) . despite all that , the setting of the country was still in japan and the characters were japanese in the dub . this series was the first to show any japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with american audiences ( such as the manju ) , which were left unedited and used in the english dub . also despite the heavy censorship and the english dub aimed at young children , some of the digimon 's attacks named after real weapons such as rizegreymon 's trident revolver are not edited and used in the english dub . well go usa released it on dvd instead of disney . the north american english dub was televised on jetix in the u.s. and on the family channel in canada .
the climate of cork , like the rest of ireland , is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes . cork lies in plant hardiness zone 9b . met éireann maintains a climatological weather station at cork airport , a few kilometres south of the city . it should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of 151 metres ( 495 ft ) and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself . there are also smaller synoptic weather stations at ucc and clover hill .
richard owen showed that fossils of extinct species darwin found in south america were allied to living species on the same continent . in march 1837 , ornithologist john gould announced that darwin 's rhea was a separate species from the previously described rhea ( though their territories overlapped ) , that mockingbirds collected on the galápagos islands represented three separate species each unique to a particular island , and that several distinct birds from those islands were all classified as finches . darwin began speculating , in a series of notebooks , on the possibility that " one species does change into another " to explain these findings , and around july sketched a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree , discarding lamarck 's independent lineages progressing to higher forms . unconventionally , darwin asked questions of fancy pigeon and animal breeders as well as established scientists . at the zoo he had his first sight of an ape , and was profoundly impressed by how human the orangutan seemed .
bomber crews already had some experience with these types of systems due to the deployment of the lorenz beam , a commercial blind-landing aid which allowed aircraft to land at night or in bad weather . the germans developed the short-range lorenz system into the knickebein aid , a system which used two lorenz beams with much stronger signal transmissions . the concept was the same as the lorenz system . two aerials were rotated for the two converging beams which were pointed to cross directly over the target . the german bombers would attach themselves to either beam and fly along it until they started to pick up the signal from the other beam . when a continuous sound was heard from the second beam the crew knew they were above the target and began dropping their bombs .
a considerable amount of new knowledge about plant function comes from studies of the molecular genetics of model plants such as the thale cress , arabidopsis thaliana , a weedy species in the mustard family ( brassicaceae ) . the genome or hereditary information contained in the genes of this species is encoded by about 135 million base pairs of dna , forming one of the smallest genomes among flowering plants . arabidopsis was the first plant to have its genome sequenced , in 2000 . the sequencing of some other relatively small genomes , of rice ( oryza sativa ) and brachypodium distachyon , has made them important model species for understanding the genetics , cellular and molecular biology of cereals , grasses and monocots generally .
according to a report published in 2014 , about 43 % of all jews reside in israel ( 6.1 million ) , and 40 % in the united states ( 5.7 million ) , with most of the remainder living in europe ( 1.4 million ) and canada ( 0.4 million ) . these numbers include all those who self-identified as jews in a socio-demographic study or were identified as such by a respondent in the same household . the exact world jewish population , however , is difficult to measure . in addition to issues with census methodology , disputes among proponents of halakhic , secular , political , and ancestral identification factors regarding who is a jew may affect the figure considerably depending on the source .
the usefulness of the canals was short-lived , though some have now been restored for recreation . the 19th century also saw the construction of railways to and through somerset . the county was served by five pre-1923 grouping railway companies : the great western railway ( gwr ) ; a branch of the midland railway ( mr ) to bath green park ( and another one to bristol ) ; the somerset and dorset joint railway , and the london and south western railway ( l & swr ) . the former main lines of the gwr are still in use today , although many of its branch lines were scrapped under the notorious beeching axe . the former lines of the somerset and dorset joint railway closed completely , as has the branch of the midland railway to bath green park ( and to bristol st philips ) ; however , the l & swr survived as a part of the present west of england main line . none of these lines , in somerset , are electrified . two branch lines , the west and east somerset railways , were rescued and transferred back to private ownership as " heritage " lines . the fifth railway was a short-lived light railway , the weston , clevedon and portishead light railway . the west somerset mineral railway carried the iron ore from the brendon hills to watchet .
to the west of the city is devonport , one of plymouth 's historic quarters . as part of devonport 's millennium regeneration project , the devonport heritage trail has been introduced , complete with over 70 waymarkers outlining the route .
during world war ii , detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the germans , but switzerland was never attacked . switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence , concessions to germany , and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion . under general henri guisan central command , a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered . the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland , to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong , well-stockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit . switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the axis and allied powers .
to promote culture utrecht city organizes cultural sundays . during a thematic sunday several organisations create a program , which is open to everyone without , or with a very much reduced , admission fee . there are also initiatives for amateur artists . the city subsidises an organisation for amateur education in arts aimed at all inhabitants ( utrechts centrum voor de kunsten ) , as does the university for its staff and students . additionally there are also several private initiatives . the city council provides coupons for discounts to inhabitants who receive welfare to be used with many of the initiatives .
heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 . his team developed a digital pcm adaptor audio tape recorder using a betamax video recorder in 1973 . after this , in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made . sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 . a year later , in september 1977 , sony showed the press a 30 cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio ( 44,100 hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution ) using mfm modulation . in september 1978 , the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time , 44,056 hz sampling rate , 16-bit linear resolution , and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980 . technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels . sony 's aes technical paper was published on 1 march 1979 . a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called " philips introduce compact disc " in eindhoven , netherlands .
since the university 's establishment in the city in 1837 , the histories of the university of michigan and ann arbor have been closely linked . the town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the michigan central railroad , and a north—south railway connecting ann arbor to toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878 . throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to ann arbor . while the earlier settlers were primarily of british ancestry , the newer settlers also consisted of germans , irish , and african-americans . in 1851 , ann arbor was chartered as a city , though the city showed a drop in population during the depression of 1873 . it was not until the early 1880s that ann arbor again saw robust growth , with new immigrants coming from greece , italy , russia , and poland . ann arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing , particularly in milling . ann arbor 's jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century , and its first and oldest synagogue , beth israel congregation , was established in 1916 .
throughout her career madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music . madonna 's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the breakfast club in 1979 . according to author carol gnojewski , her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation , as madonna said : " i do n't know where [ the songs ] came from . it was like magic . i 'd write a song every day . i said 'wow , i was meant to do this ' . " mark kamins , her first producer , believed that madonna is " a much underrated musician and lyricist . " rolling stone has named her " an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics . " according to freya jarman-ivens , madonna 's talent for developing " incredible " hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience , even without the influence of the music . as an example , jarman-ivens cites the 1985 single " into the groove " and its line " live out your fantasy here with me , just let the music set you free ; touch my body , and move in time , now i know you 're mine . " madonna 's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years , dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment . her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period , such as sexuality and aids on erotica ( 1992 ) . many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre , which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars . madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the songwriters hall of fame twice , for 2014 and 2016 ceremony . rolling stone listed madonna at number 56 on the " 100 greatest songwriters of all time " .
on 15 august 2006 , brian may confirmed through his website and fan club that queen + paul rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in october , to be recorded at a " secret location " . queen + paul rodgers performed at the nelson mandela 90th birthday tribute held in hyde park , london on 27 june 2008 , to commemorate mandela 's ninetieth birthday , and again promote awareness of the hiv/aids pandemic . the first queen + paul rodgers album , titled the cosmos rocks , was released in europe on 12 september 2008 and in the united states on 28 october 2008 . following the release of the album , the band again went on a tour through europe , opening on kharkiv 's freedom square in front of 350,000 ukrainian fans . the kharkiv concert was later released on dvd . the tour then moved to russia , and the band performed two sold-out shows at the moscow arena . having completed the first leg of its extensive european tour , which saw the band play 15 sold-out dates across nine countries , the uk leg of the tour sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale and included three london dates , the first of which was the o2 on 13 october . the last leg of the tour took place in south america , and included a sold-out concert at the estadio josé amalfitani , buenos aires .
the catholic church uses wine in the celebration of the eucharist because it is part of the tradition passed down through the ages starting with jesus christ at the last supper , where catholics believe the consecrated bread and wine literally become the body and blood of jesus christ , a dogma known as transubstantiation . wine is used ( not grape juice ) both due to its strong scriptural roots , and also to follow the tradition set by the early christian church . the code of canon law of the catholic church ( 1983 ) , canon 924 says that the wine used must be natural , made from grapes of the vine , and not corrupt . in some circumstances , a priest may obtain special permission to use grape juice for the consecration , however this is extremely rare and typically requires sufficient impetus to warrant such a dispensation , such as personal health of the priest .
the gold standard act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains ( 1.505 g ) of gold , equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $ 20.67 . silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964 , when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters , and the half dollar was reduced to 40 % silver . silver half dollars were last issued for circulation in 1970 . gold coins were confiscated by executive order 6102 issued in 1933 by franklin roosevelt . the gold standard was changed to 13.71 grains ( 0.888 g ) , equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $ 35 . this standard persisted until 1968 .
the government of guam maintains the island 's main health care facility , guam memorial hospital , in tamuning . u.s. board certified doctors and dentists practice in all specialties . in addition , the u.s . naval hospital in agana heights serves active-duty members and dependents of the military community . there is one subscriber-based air ambulance located on the island , carejet , which provides emergency patient transportation across guam and surrounding islands . a private hospital , the guam regional medical city opened its doors in early 2016 .
inner and outer vestibules lead to the octagonal chapter house , which is of exceptional architectural purity . it is built in a geometrical gothic style with an octagonal crypt below . a pier of eight shafts carries the vaulted ceiling . to the sides are blind arcading , remains of 14th-century paintings and numerous stone benches above which are innovatory large 4-light quatre-foiled windows . these are virtually contemporary with the sainte-chapelle , paris .
local train services operate in the central , southern and eastern sections of the city and are operated by south west trains , with stations at swaythling , st denys , millbrook , redbridge , bitterne , sholing and woolston . plans were announced by hampshire county council in july 2009 for the introduction of tram-train running from hythe ( on what is now a freight-only line to fawley ) via totton to southampton central station and on to fareham via st. denys , and swanwick . the proposal follows a failed plan to bring light rail to the portsmouth and gosport areas in 2005 .
autumn , winter , and early spring are frequently characterized by rain . winters are cool and wet with december , the coolest month , averaging 40.6 °f ( 4.8 °c ) , with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark , and 2.0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day ; the temperature rarely lowers to 20 °f ( −7 °c ) . summers are sunny , dry and warm , with august , the warmest month , averaging 66.1 °f ( 18.9 °c ) , and with temperatures reaching 90 °f ( 32 °c ) on 3.1 days per year , although 2011 is the most recent year to not reach 90 °f . the hottest officially recorded temperature was 103 °f ( 39 °c ) on july 29 , 2009 ; the coldest recorded temperature was 0 °f ( −18 °c ) on january 31 , 1950 ; the record cold daily maximum is 16 °f ( −9 °c ) on january 14 , 1950 , while , conversely , the record warm daily minimum is 71 °f ( 22 °c ) the day the official record high was set . the average window for freezing temperatures is november 16 thru march 10 , allowing a growing season of 250 days .
others argue that reason was generally held in high regard during the middle ages . science historian edward grant writes , " if revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed [ in the 18th century ] , they were only made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities " . also , contrary to common belief , david lindberg writes , " the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free ( particularly in the natural sciences ) to follow reason and observation wherever they led " .
when a molten metal is mixed with another substance , there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form , called atom exchange and the interstitial mechanism . the relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur . when the atoms are relatively similar in size , the atom exchange method usually happens , where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent . this is called a substitutional alloy . examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass , in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms . with the interstitial mechanism , one atom is usually much smaller than the other , so can not successfully replace an atom in the crystals of the base metal . the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms in the crystal matrix , called the interstices . this is referred to as an interstitial alloy . steel is an example of an interstitial alloy , because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix . stainless steel is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys , because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices , but some of the iron atoms are replaced with nickel and chromium atoms .
ottoman turkish was the official language of the empire . it was an oghuz turkic language highly influenced by persian and arabic . the ottomans had several influential languages : turkish , spoken by the majority of the people in anatolia and by the majority of muslims of the balkans except in albania and bosnia ; persian , only spoken by the educated ; arabic , spoken mainly in arabia , north africa , iraq , kuwait , the levant and parts of the horn of africa ; and somali throughout the horn of africa . in the last two centuries , usage of these became limited , though , and specific : persian served mainly as a literary language for the educated , while arabic was used for religious rites .
the kuru kingdom was the first state-level society of the vedic period , corresponding to the beginning of the iron age in northwestern india , around 1200 – 800 bce , as well as with the composition of the atharvaveda ( the first indian text to mention iron , as śyāma ayas , literally " black metal " ) . the kuru state organized the vedic hymns into collections , and developed the orthodox srauta ritual to uphold the social order . when the kuru kingdom declined , the center of vedic culture shifted to their eastern neighbours , the panchala kingdom . the archaeological painted grey ware culture , which flourished in the haryana and western uttar pradesh regions of northern india from about 1100 to 600 bce , is believed to correspond to the kuru and panchala kingdoms .
antennas are characterized by a number of performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application . chief among these relate to the directional characteristics ( as depicted in the antenna 's radiation pattern ) and the resulting gain . even in omnidirectional ( or weakly directional ) antennas , the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions , sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground . the antenna 's power gain ( or simply " gain " ) also takes into account the antenna 's efficiency , and is often the primary figure of merit .
rome had a semi-divine ancestor in the trojan refugee aeneas , son of venus , who was said to have established the nucleus of roman religion when he brought the palladium , lares and penates from troy to italy . these objects were believed in historical times to remain in the keeping of the vestals , rome 's female priesthood . aeneas had been given refuge by king evander , a greek exile from arcadia , to whom were attributed other religious foundations : he established the ara maxima , " greatest altar , " to hercules at the site that would become the forum boarium , and he was the first to celebrate the lupercalia , an archaic festival in february that was celebrated as late as the 5th century of the christian era .
much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences . new york city has the most post-graduate life sciences degrees awarded annually in the united states , with 127 nobel laureates having roots in local institutions as of 2004 ; while in 2012 , 43,523 licensed physicians were practicing in new york city . major biomedical research institutions include memorial sloan–kettering cancer center , rockefeller university , suny downstate medical center , albert einstein college of medicine , mount sinai school of medicine , and weill cornell medical college , being joined by the cornell university/technion-israel institute of technology venture on roosevelt island .
in the first three seasons , the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night . in season one , there were three groups of ten , with the top three contestants from each group making the finals . in seasons two and three , there were four groups of eight , and the top two of each selected . these seasons also featured a wildcard round , where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance . in season one , only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges , giving a total of ten finalists . in seasons two and three , each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals , making 12 finalists in all .
rejecting offers to direct jaws 2 , king kong and superman , spielberg and actor richard dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about ufos , which became close encounters of the third kind ( 1977 ) . one of the rare films both written and directed by spielberg , close encounters was a critical and box office hit , giving spielberg his first best director nomination from the academy as well as earning six other academy awards nominations . it won oscars in two categories ( cinematography , vilmos zsigmond , and a special achievement award for sound effects editing , frank e. warner ) . this second blockbuster helped to secure spielberg 's rise . his next film , 1941 , a big-budgeted world war ii farce , was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $ 92.4 million worldwide ( and did make a small profit for co-producing studios columbia and universal ) it was seen as a disappointment , mainly with the critics .
political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the guild was subordinated to the theory of free trade , and roman catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by protestant churches subordinate to each nation-state , which also ( in a fashion the roman catholic church often decried angrily ) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region . however , the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion , particularly christianity . the most outspoken critic of the church in france was françois marie arouet de voltaire , a representative figure of the enlightenment . after voltaire , religion would never be the same again in france .
erich koch headed the east prussian nazi party from 1928 . he led the district from 1932 . this period was characterized by efforts to collectivize the local agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with his critics inside and outside the party . he also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province . these actions made him unpopular among the local peasants . in 1932 the local paramilitary sa had already started to terrorise their political opponents . on the night of 31 july 1932 there was a bomb attack on the headquarters of the social democrats in königsberg , the otto-braun-house . the communist politician gustav sauf was killed ; the executive editor of the social democrat " königsberger volkszeitung " , otto wyrgatsch , and the german people 's party politician max von bahrfeldt were severely injured . members of the reichsbanner were attacked and the local reichsbanner chairman of lötzen , kurt kotzan , was murdered on 6 august 1932 .
different religious traditions assign differing ( though often similar ) attributes and characteristics to god , including expansive powers and abilities , psychological characteristics , gender characteristics , and preferred nomenclature . the assignment of these attributes often differs according to the conceptions of god in the culture from which they arise . for example , attributes of god in christianity , attributes of god in islam , and the thirteen attributes of mercy in judaism share certain similarities arising from their common roots .
by 1620 , the fishermen of england 's west country controlled most of newfoundland 's east coast . in 1627 , william payne , called st. john 's " the principal prime and chief lot in all the whole country " . the population grew slowly in the 17th century and st. john 's was the largest settlement in newfoundland when english naval officers began to take censuses around 1675 . the population would grow in the summers with the arrival of migratory fishermen . in 1680 , fishing ships ( mostly from south devon ) set up fishing rooms at st. john 's , bringing hundreds of irish men into the port to operate inshore fishing boats .
the 19th-century liberal prime minister william ewart gladstone considered burke " a magazine of wisdom on ireland and america " and in his diary recorded : " made many extracts from burke—sometimes almost divine " . the radical mp and anti-corn law activist richard cobden often praised burke 's thoughts and details on scarcity . the liberal historian lord acton considered burke one of the three greatest liberals , along with william gladstone and thomas babington macaulay . lord macaulay recorded in his diary : " i have now finished reading again most of burke 's works . admirable ! the greatest man since milton " . the gladstonian liberal mp john morley published two books on burke ( including a biography ) and was influenced by burke , including his views on prejudice . the cobdenite radical francis hirst thought burke deserved " a place among english libertarians , even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative , the least abstract , always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate . in politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site " . burke 's reflections on the revolution in france was controversial at the time of its publication , but after his death , it was to become his best known and most influential work , and a manifesto for conservative thinking .
according to his autobiography , avicenna had memorised the entire quran by the age of 10 . he learned indian arithmetic from an indian greengrocer , ءmahmoud massahi and he began to learn more from a wandering scholar who gained a livelihood by curing the sick and teaching the young . he also studied fiqh ( islamic jurisprudence ) under the sunni hanafi scholar ismail al-zahid . avicenna was taught some extent of philosophy books such as introduction ( isagoge ) 's porphyry ( philosopher ) , euclid 's elements , ptolemy 's almagest by an unpopular philosopher , abu abdullah nateli , who claimed philosophizing .
despite its relative lexical unity , the two dialectal blocks of catalan ( eastern and western ) show some differences in word choices . any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism . also , usually central catalan acts as an innovative element .
laserdisc 's support for multiple audio tracks allowed for vast supplemental materials to be included on-disc and made it the first available format for " special edition " releases ; the 1984 criterion collection edition of citizen kane is generally credited as being the first " special edition " release to home video , [ citation needed ] and for setting the standard by which future se discs were measured . the disc provided interviews , commentary tracks , documentaries , still photographs , and other features for historians and collectors .
in 1820-1830 ’ s the ottoman empire endured a number of strikes which challenged the existence of the country . the greek uprising ( began in the spring of 1821 ) evidenced internal and military weakness of ottoman empire and caused severe atrocities by ottoman military forces ( see chios massacre ) . the disbandment of the centuries-old janissary corps by sultan mahmud ii on 15 june 1826 ( auspicious incident ) was a good deed for the country in the longer term , but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future . in 1827 the allied anglo-franco-russian fleet destroyed almost all the ottoman naval forces during the battle of navarino . in 1830 greece becomes an independent state after 10 years of independence war and the russo-turkish war of 1828–1829 . according to the treaty of adrianople ( 1829 ) russian and european commercial ships were authorized to freely pass through black sea straits , serbia received autonomy , and danubian principalities ( moldavia and walachia ) became the territories under russian protection .
agrobacterium tumefaciens , a soil rhizosphere bacterium , can attach to plant cells and infect them with a callus-inducing ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer , causing a callus infection called crown gall disease . schell and van montagu ( 1977 ) hypothesised that the ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species . today , genetic modification of the ti plasmid is one of the main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops .
in the al-burhan ( on demonstration ) section of the book of healing , avicenna discussed the philosophy of science and described an early scientific method of inquiry . he discusses aristotle 's posterior analytics and significantly diverged from it on several points . avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of " how does one acquire the first principles of a science ? " he asked how a scientist would arrive at " the initial axioms or hypotheses of a deductive science without inferring them from some more basic premises ? " he explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a " relation holds between the terms , which would allow for absolute , universal certainty . " avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the first principles : the ancient aristotelian method of induction ( istiqra ) , and the method of examination and experimentation ( tajriba ) . avicenna criticized aristotelian induction , arguing that " it does not lead to the absolute , universal , and certain premises that it purports to provide . " in its place , he develops a " method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry . "
in the 21st century the most famous department store in russia is gum in moscow , followed by tsum and the petrovsky passage . other popular stores are mega ( shopping malls ) , stockmann , and marks & spencer . media markt , m-video , technosila , and white wind ( beliy veter ) sell large number of electronic devices . in st. petersburg the passage has been popular since the 1840s . 1956 soviet film behind store window ( за витриной универмага ) on youtube depicts operation of a moscow department store in 1950 's .
while leds have the advantage over fluorescent lamps that they do not contain mercury , they may contain other hazardous metals such as lead and arsenic . regarding the toxicity of leds when treated as waste , a study published in 2011 stated : " according to federal standards , leds are not hazardous except for low-intensity red leds , which leached pb [ lead ] at levels exceeding regulatory limits ( 186 mg/l ; regulatory limit : 5 ) . however , according to california regulations , excessive levels of copper ( up to 3892 mg/kg ; limit : 2500 ) , lead ( up to 8103 mg/kg ; limit : 1000 ) , nickel ( up to 4797 mg/kg ; limit : 2000 ) , or silver ( up to 721 mg/kg ; limit : 500 ) render all except low-intensity yellow leds hazardous . "
from 1842 onwards , chopin showed signs of serious illness . after a solo recital in paris on 21 february 1842 , he wrote to grzymała : " i have to lie in bed all day long , my mouth and tonsils are aching so much . " he was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the beethoven seventh symphony arrangement at erard 's on 1 march 1843 . late in 1844 , charles hallé visited chopin and found him " hardly able to move , bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain " , although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor . chopin 's health continued to deteriorate , particularly from this time onwards . modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses , he may also have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy .
the british and french struggles in india became but one theatre of the global seven years ' war ( 1756–1763 ) involving france , britain and the other major european powers . the signing of the treaty of paris ( 1763 ) had important consequences for the future of the british empire . in north america , france 's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the recognition of british claims to rupert 's land , and the ceding of new france to britain ( leaving a sizeable french-speaking population under british control ) and louisiana to spain . spain ceded florida to britain . along with its victory over france in india , the seven years ' war therefore left britain as the world 's most powerful maritime power .
in spring 1987 , a protest movement arose against new phosphate mines in estonia . signatures were collected in tartu , and students assembled in the university 's main hall to express lack of confidence in the government . at a demonstration on may 1 , 1987 , young people showed up with banners and slogans despite an official ban . on august 15 , 1987 , former political prisoners formed the mrp-aeg group ( estonians for the public disclosure of the molotov-ribbentrop pact ) , which was headed by tiit madisson . in september 1987 , the edasi newspaper published a proposal by edgar savisaar , siim kallas , tiit made , and mikk titma calling for estonia 's transition to autonomy . initially geared toward economic independence , then toward a certain amount of political autonomy , the project , isemajandav eesti ( " a self-managing estonia " ) became known according to its estonian acronym , ime , which means " miracle " . on october 21 , a demonstration dedicated to those who gave their lives in the 1918–1920 estonian war of independence took place in võru , which culminated in a conflict with the militia . for the first time in years , the blue , black , and white national tricolor was publicly displayed .
an urban civilization , the garamantes , arose around 500 bce in the heart of the sahara , in a valley that is now called the wadi al-ajal in fezzan , libya . the garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields . the garamantes grew populous and strong , conquering their neighbors and capturing many slaves ( which were put to work extending the tunnels ) . the ancient greeks and the romans knew of the garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads . however , they traded with the garamantes , and a roman bath has been found in the garamantes capital of garama . archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the garamantes territory . the garamantes civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains .
the use of the term middle east as a region of international affairs apparently began in british and american diplomatic circles quite independently of each other over concern for the security of the same country : iran , then known to the west as persia . in 1900 thomas edward gordon published an article , the problem of the middle east , which began :
one major difference between baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in ensembles were much less standardized . whereas a classical era string quartet consists almost exclusively of two violins , a viola and a cello , a baroque group accompanying a soloist or opera could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments ( e.g. , pipe organ , harpsichord , or clavichord ) , additional stringed chordal instruments ( e.g. , a lute ) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo bassline , including bowed strings , woodwinds and brass instruments ( e.g. , a cello , contrabass , viol , bassoon , serpent , etc . ) .
on may 20 , 1971 , his brother , meinhard , died in a car accident . meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly . schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral . meinhard was due to marry erika knapp , and the couple had a three-year-old son , patrick . schwarzenegger would pay for patrick 's education and help him to emigrate to the united states . gustav died the following year from a stroke . in pumping iron , schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father 's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest . later , he and the film 's producer said this story was taken from another bodybuilder for the purpose of showing the extremes that some would go to for their sport and to make schwarzenegger 's image more cold and machine-like in order to fan controversy for the film . barbara baker , his first serious girlfriend , has said he informed her of his father 's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother . over time , he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father 's funeral .
two days after " 1984 " aired , the macintosh went on sale , and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface : macwrite and macpaint . it was first demonstrated by steve jobs in the first of his famous mac keynote speeches , and though the mac garnered an immediate , enthusiastic following , some labeled it a mere " toy . " because the operating system was designed largely around the gui , existing text-mode and command-driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten . this was a time-consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake , and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system . in april 1984 , microsoft 's multiplan migrated over from ms-dos , with microsoft word following in january 1985 . in 1985 , lotus software introduced lotus jazz for the macintosh platform after the success of lotus 1-2-3 for the ibm pc , although it was largely a flop . apple introduced the macintosh office suite the same year with the " lemmings " ad . infamous for insulting its own potential customers , the ad was not successful .
stansted airport , north east of london in essex , is a local uk hub and luton airport to the north of london in bedfordshire , caters mostly for cheap short-haul flights . london city airport , the smallest and most central airport , in newham , east london , is focused on business travellers , with a mixture of full service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic . london southend airport , east of london in essex , is a smaller , regional airport that mainly caters for cheap short-haul flights .
the party of reconstruction in sicily , which claimed 40,000 members in 1944 , campaigned for sicily to be admitted as a u.s. state . this party was one of several sicilian separatist movements active after the downfall of italian fascism . sicilians felt neglected or underrepresented by the italian government after the annexation of 1861 that ended the rule of the kingdom of the two sicilies based in naples . the large population of sicilians in america and the american-led allied invasion of sicily in july–august 1943 may have contributed to the sentiment .
there was already regulation on public drinking spaces in the 17th and 18th centuries , [ citation needed ] and the income earned from licences was beneficial to the crown . tavern owners were required to possess a licence to sell ale , and a separate licence for distilled spirits .
residents of saint-barthélemy ( saint-barthélemoise people ) are french citizens and work at establishments on the island . most of them are descendants of the first settlers , of breton , norman , poitevin , saintongeais and angevin lineage . french is the native tongue of the population . english is understood in hotels and restaurants , and a small population of anglophones have been resident in gustavia for many years . the st. barthélemy french patois is spoken by some 500–700 people in the leeward portion of the island and is superficially related to quebec french , whereas créole french is limited to the windward side . unlike other populations in the caribbean , language preference between the créole and patois is geographically , and not racially , determined .

gymnasts sprint down a runway , which is a maximum of 25 meters in length , before hurdling onto a spring board . the gymnast is allowed to choose where they start on the runway . the body position is maintained while " punching " ( blocking using only a shoulder movement ) the vaulting platform . the gymnast then rotates to a standing position . in advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing . successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
charles peirce ( 1839–1914 ) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today 's empirical scientific method . [ citation needed ] although peirce severely criticized many elements of descartes ' peculiar brand of rationalism , he did not reject rationalism outright . indeed , he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism , most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation . in later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism , in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the " data-driven " strict-empiricist view .
starting with republican nicholas longworth in 1925 , and continued through the democrats ' control of the house from 1931 to 1995 , save for republican majorities in 1947–49 and 1953–55 , all majority leaders have directly ascended to the speakership brought upon by the retirement of the incumbent . the only exceptions during this period were charles a. halleck who became republican house leader and minority leader from 1959 to 1965 , hale boggs who died in a plane crash , and dick gephardt who became the democrats ' house leader but as minority leader since his party lost control in the 1994 midterm elections . since 1995 , the only majority leader to become speaker is john boehner , though indirectly as his party lost control in the 2006 midterms elections . he subsequently served as republican house leader and minority leader from 2007 to 2011 and then was elected speaker when the house reconvened in 2011 . in 1998 , with speaker newt gingrich announcing his resignation , both majority leader dick armey and majority whip tom delay did not contest the speakership which eventually went to chief deputy whip dennis hastert .
in mathematics , the persian mathematician muhammad ibn musa al-khwarizmi gave his name to the concept of the algorithm , while the term algebra is derived from al-jabr , the beginning of the title of one of his publications . what is now known as arabic numerals originally came from india , but muslim mathematicians did make several refinements to the number system , such as the introduction of decimal point notation . sabian mathematician al-battani ( 850-929 ) contributed to astronomy and mathematics , while persian scholar al-razi contributed to chemistry and medicine .
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies . political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started increasingly to study more " complex " social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena . the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels . first of all , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere ( as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization ) . second of all , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions ( and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions ) . an anthropology of the state developed , and it is a most thriving field today . geertz ' comparative work on " negara " , the balinese state is an early , famous example .
stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for premier league clubs . for the 2009–10 season , average attendances across the league clubs were 34,215 for premier league matches with a total aggregate attendance figure of 13,001,616 . this represents an increase of 13,089 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the league 's first season ( 1992–93 ) . however , during the 1992–93 season the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the taylor report 's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums . the premier league 's record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season . this record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with a total attendance of just under 14 million , the highest average in england 's top flight since 1950 .
the annelids are bilaterally symmetrical , triploblastic , coelomate , invertebrate organisms . they also have parapodia for locomotion . most textbooks still use the traditional division into polychaetes ( almost all marine ) , oligochaetes ( which include earthworms ) and leech-like species . cladistic research since 1997 has radically changed this scheme , viewing leeches as a sub-group of oligochaetes and oligochaetes as a sub-group of polychaetes . in addition , the pogonophora , echiura and sipuncula , previously regarded as separate phyla , are now regarded as sub-groups of polychaetes . annelids are considered members of the lophotrochozoa , a " super-phylum " of protostomes that also includes molluscs , brachiopods , flatworms and nemerteans .
title iv of the 1978 spanish constitution invests the consentimiento real ( royal assent ) and promulgation ( publication ) of laws with the monarch of spain , while title iii , the cortes generales , chapter 2 , drafting of bills , outlines the method by which bills are passed . according to article 91 , within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the cortes generales , the sovereign shall give his or her assent and publish the new law . article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum , on the advice of the president of the government ( commonly referred to in english as the prime minister ) and the authorisation of the cortes .
on february 8 , 1847 , doniphan continued his march with 924 men mostly from missouri ; he accompanied a train of 315 wagons of a large commercial caravan heading to the state capital . meanwhile , the mexican forces in the state had time to prepare a defense against the americans . about 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of the capital where two mountain ranges join from east to west is the only pass into the capital ; known as sacramento pass , this point is now part of present-day chihuahua city . the battle of sacramento was the most important battle fought in the state of chihuahua because it was the sole defense for the state capital . the battle ended quickly because of some devastating defensive errors from the mexican forces and the ingenious strategic moves by the american forces . after their loss at the battle of sacramento , the remaining mexican soldiers retreated south , leaving the city to american occupation . almost 300 mexicans were killed in the battle , as well as almost 300 wounded . the americans also confiscated large amounts of mexican supplies and took 400 mexican soldiers prisoners of war . american forces maintained an occupation of the state capital for the rest of the mexican–american war .
following the protestant reformation , promoted by local reformer martin bucer , the principle of cuius regio , eius religio led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern alsace . landowners , who as " local lords " had the right to decide which religion was allowed on their land , were eager to entice populations from the more attractive lowlands to settle and develop their property . many accepted without discrimination catholics , lutherans , calvinists , jews and anabaptists . multiconfessional villages appeared , particularly in the region of alsace bossue . alsace became one of the french regions boasting a thriving jewish community , and the only region with a noticeable anabaptist population . the schism of the amish under the lead of jacob amman from the mennonites occurred in 1693 in sainte-marie-aux-mines . the strongly catholic louis xiv tried in vain to drive them from alsace . when napoleon imposed military conscription without religious exception , most emigrated to the american continent .
the uk government has spent £250 million in the construction of the island 's airport . expected to be fully operational early 2016 , it is expected to help the island towards self-sufficiency and encourage economic development , reducing dependence on british government aid . the airport is also expected to kick start the tourism industry , with up to 30,000 visitors expected annually . as of august , 2015 ticketing was postponed until an airline could be firmly designated .
according to john everett-heath , the author of oxford concise dictionary of world place names , hyderabad means " haydar 's city " or " lion city " , from haydar ( lion ) and ābād ( city ) . it was named to honour the caliph ali ibn abi talib , who was also known as haydar because of his lion-like valour in battles . andrew petersen , a scholar of islamic architecture , says the city was originally called baghnagar ( city of gardens ) . one popular theory suggests that muhammad quli qutb shah , the founder of the city , named it " bhagyanagar " or " bhāgnagar " after bhagmati , a local nautch ( dancing ) girl with whom he had fallen in love . she converted to islam and adopted the title hyder mahal . the city was renamed hyderabad in her honour . according to another source , the city was named after haidar , the son of quli qutb shah .
in 1952 , thomas j. watson , jr. , published the company 's first written equal opportunity policy letter , one year before the u.s. supreme court decision in brown vs. board of education and 11 years before the civil rights act of 1964 . in 1961 , ibm 's nondiscrimination policy was expanded to include sex , national origin , and age . the following year , ibm hosted its first invention award dinner honoring 34 outstanding ibm inventors ; and in 1963 , the company named the first eight ibm fellows in a new fellowship program that recognizes senior ibm scientists , engineers and other professionals for outstanding technical achievements .
in latin america and english-speaking countries , most wrestlers ( and other on-stage performers ) portray character roles , sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own . these personalities are a gimmick intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability . some can be unrealistic and cartoon-like ( such as doink the clown ) , while others carry more verisimilitude and can be seen as exaggerated versions of the performer 's real life personality ( such as chris jericho , the rock , john cena , stone cold steve austin , and cm punk ) . in lucha libre , many characters wear masks , adopting a secret identity akin to a superhero , a near-sacred tradition .
the name of the winning team is engraved on the silver band around the base as soon as the final has finished , in order to be ready in time for the presentation ceremony . this means the engraver has just five minutes to perform a task which would take twenty under normal conditions , although time is saved by engraving the year on during the match , and sketching the presumed winner . during the final , the trophy wears is decorated with ribbons in the colours of both finalists , with the loser 's ribbons being removed at the end of the game . traditionally , at wembley finals , the presentation is made at the royal box , with players , led by the captain , mounting a staircase to a gangway in front of the box and returning by a second staircase on the other side of the box . at cardiff the presentation was made on a podium on the pitch .
animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things . animals are eukaryotic and multicellular , which separates them from bacteria and most protists . they are heterotrophic , generally digesting food in an internal chamber , which separates them from plants and algae . they are also distinguished from plants , algae , and fungi by lacking rigid cell walls . all animals are motile , if only at certain life stages . in most animals , embryos pass through a blastula stage , which is a characteristic exclusive to animals .
broadband wireless services were offered by both dial up and non-dial up isps in major cities , such as mogadishu , bosaso , hargeisa , galkayo and kismayo . pricing ranged from $ 150 to $ 300 a month for unlimited internet access , with bandwidth rates of 64 kbit/s up and down . the main patrons of these wireless services were scholastic institutions , corporations , and un , ngo and diplomatic missions . mogadishu had the biggest subscriber base nationwide and was also the headquarters of the largest wireless internet services , among which were dalkom ( wanaag hk ) , orbit , unitel and webtel .
by the end of the decade a distinct genre of hard rock was emerging with bands like led zeppelin , who mixed the music of early rock bands with a more hard-edged form of blues rock and acid rock on their first two albums led zeppelin ( 1969 ) and led zeppelin ii ( 1969 ) , and deep purple , who began as a progressive rock group but achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album , in rock ( 1970 ) . also significant was black sabbath 's paranoid ( 1970 ) , which combined guitar riffs with dissonance and more explicit references to the occult and elements of gothic horror . all three of these bands have been seen as pivotal in the development of heavy metal , but where metal further accentuated the intensity of the music , with bands like judas priest following sabbath 's lead into territory that was often " darker and more menacing " , hard rock tended to continue to remain the more exuberant , good-time music .
in early 1991 , non-arabs of the zaghawa tribe of sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying arab apartheid campaign , segregating arabs and non-arabs ( specifically people of sub-saharan african descent ) . sudanese arabs , who controlled the government , were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against sudan 's non-arab citizens . the government was accused of " deftly manipulat ( ing ) arab solidarity " to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing .

in the 14th century , much of the greek peninsula was lost by the byzantine empire at first to the serbs and then to the ottomans . by the beginning of the 15th century , the ottoman advance meant that byzantine territory in greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city , thessaloniki , and the peloponnese ( despotate of the morea ) . after the fall of constantinople to the ottomans in 1453 , the morea was the last remnant of the byzantine empire to hold out against the ottomans . however , this , too , fell to the ottomans in 1460 , completing the ottoman conquest of mainland greece . with the turkish conquest , many byzantine greek scholars , who up until then were largely responsible for preserving classical greek knowledge , fled to the west , taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the renaissance .
at times a character may " turn " , altering their face/heel alignment . this may be an abrupt , surprising event , or it may slowly build up over time . it almost always is accomplished with a markable change in behavior on the part of the character . some turns become defining points in a wrestler 's career , as was the case when hulk hogan turned heel after being a top face for over a decade . others may have no noticeable effect on the character 's status . if a character repeatedly switches between being a face and heel , this lessens the effect of such turns , and may result in apathy from the audience . vince mcmahon is a good example of having more heel and face turns than anyone in wwe history .
in some decorative applications , wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest . in applications where wood is painted , such as skirting boards , fascia boards , door frames and furniture , resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed ' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain . a knot primer paint or solution , correctly applied during preparation , may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely , especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks .
in 1919 , following the treaty of versailles , the city was restituted to france in accordance with u.s. president woodrow wilson 's " fourteen points " without a referendum . the date of the assignment was retroactively established on armistice day . it is doubtful whether a referendum in strasbourg would have ended in france 's favour since the political parties striving for an autonomous alsace or a connection to france accounted only for a small proportion of votes in the last reichstag as well as in the local elections . the alsatian autonomists who were pro french had won many votes in the more rural parts of the region and other towns since the annexation of the region by germany in 1871 . the movement started with the first election for the reichstag ; those elected were called " les députés protestataires " , and until the fall of bismarck in 1890 , they were the only deputies elected by the alsatians to the german parliament demanding the return of those territories to france . at the last reichstag election in strasbourg and its periphery , the clear winners were the social democrats ; the city was the administrative capital of the region , was inhabited by many germans appointed by the central government in berlin and its flourishing economy attracted many germans . this could explain the difference between the rural vote and the one in strasbourg . after the war , many germans left strasbourg and went back to germany ; some of them were denounced by the locals or expelled by the newly appointed authorities . the saverne affair was vivid in the memory among the alsatians .
streets ' names change from west to east ( for instance , east 10th street to west 10th street ) at broadway below 8th street , and at fifth avenue from 8th street and above .
japanese land forces continued to advance in the solomon islands and new guinea . from july 1942 , a few australian reserve battalions , many of them very young and untrained , fought a stubborn rearguard action in new guinea , against a japanese advance along the kokoda track , towards port moresby , over the rugged owen stanley ranges . the militia , worn out and severely depleted by casualties , were relieved in late august by regular troops from the second australian imperial force , returning from action in the mediterranean theater . in early september 1942 japanese marines attacked a strategic royal australian air force base at milne bay , near the eastern tip of new guinea . they were beaten back by allied ( primarily australian army ) forces .
in the early middle ages , from the end of the 4th century , the western extent of modern-day switzerland was part of the territory of the kings of the burgundians . the alemanni settled the swiss plateau in the 5th century and the valleys of the alps in the 8th century , forming alemannia . modern-day switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of alemannia and burgundy . the entire region became part of the expanding frankish empire in the 6th century , following clovis i 's victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in 504 ad , and later frankish domination of the burgundians .
most mature clitellates ( the group that includes earthworms and leeches ) are full hermaphrodites , although in a few leech species younger adults function as males and become female at maturity . all have well-developed gonads , and all copulate . earthworms store their partners ' sperm in spermathecae ( " sperm stores " ) and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and then sperm from the spermathecae . fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon . leeches ' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries , and then transferred to the cocoon . in all clitellates the cocoon also either produces yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing . all clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae .
about two thousand roman colonists were settled there in 138 bc during the rule of consul decimus junius brutus galaico . the roman historian florus says that brutus transferred the soldiers who had fought under him to that province . this was a typical roman city in its conception , as it was located in a strategic location near the sea on a river island crossed by the via augusta , the imperial road that connected the province to rome , the capital of the empire . the centre of the city was located in the present-day neighbourhood of the plaza de la virgen . here was the forum and the crossing of the cardo maximus and the decumanus maximus , which remain the two main axes of the city . the cardo corresponds to the existing calle de salvador , almoina , and the decumanus corresponds to calle de los caballeros .

the western emperor gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus , and against the protests of the senate , removed the altar of victory from the senate house and began the disestablishment of the vestals . theodosius i briefly re-united the empire : in 391 he officially adopted nicene christianity as the imperial religion and ended official support for all other creeds and cults . he not only refused to restore victory to the senate-house , but extinguished the sacred fire of the vestals and vacated their temple : the senatorial protest was expressed in a letter by quintus aurelius symmachus to the western and eastern emperors . ambrose , the influential bishop of milan and future saint , wrote urging the rejection of symmachus 's request for tolerance . yet theodosius accepted comparison with hercules and jupiter as a living divinity in the panegyric of pacatus , and despite his active dismantling of rome 's traditional cults and priesthoods could commend his heirs to its overwhelmingly hellenic senate in traditional hellenic terms . [ clarification needed ] he was the last emperor of both east and west .
in the u.s. , for example , copyright case law contains a substantial similarity requirement to determine whether the work was copied . likewise , courts may require computer software to pass an abstraction-filtration-comparison test ( afc test ) to determine if it is too abstract to qualify for protection , or too dissimilar to an original work to be considered infringing . software-related case law has also clarified that the amount of r & d , effort and expense put into a work 's creation does n't affect copyright protection .

in the uk the royal society for the prevention of accidents supports a proposal to observe sdst 's additional hour year-round , but is opposed in some industries , such as postal workers and farmers , and particularly by those living in the northern regions of the uk .
theories given for the success of southerners on idol have been : more versatility with musical genres , as the southern u.s. is home to several music genre scenes ; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business ; text-voting due to the south having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households ; and the strong heritage of music and singing , which is notable in the bible belt , where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing . others also suggest that the southern character of these contestants appeal to the south , as well as local pride . according to season five winner taylor hicks , who is from the state of alabama , " people in the south have a lot of pride ... so , they 're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region .

with the advent of the industrial revolution , britain surged ahead of its european rivals . demand for indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war , and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production . as home to the revolution , britain experienced higher standards of living . its spiralling cycle of prosperity , demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade . the company became the single largest player in the british global market . william henry pyne notes in his book the microcosm of london ( 1808 ) that :
scholars have debated the relationship and differences within āstika philosophies and with nāstika philosophies , starting with the writings of indologists and orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries , which were themselves derived from limited availability of indian literature and medieval doxographies . the various sibling traditions included in hindu philosophies are diverse , and they are united by shared history and concepts , same textual resources , similar ontological and soteriological focus , and cosmology . while buddhism and jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions , some heterodox traditions such as cārvāka are often considered as distinct schools within hindu philosophy .
unlike most languages that use alphabets to indicate the pronunciation , chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints to its pronunciation . although the written characters remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years , the pronunciation and grammar in different regions has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible . as a series of migration to the south throughout the history , the regional languages of the south , including xiang , wu , gan , min , yue ( cantonese ) , and hakka often show traces of old chinese or middle chinese . from the ming dynasty onward , beijing has been the capital of china and the dialect spoken in beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties . with the founding of the republic of china , standard mandarin was designated as the official language , based on the spoken language of beijing . since then , other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan ( dialects ) . cantonese is still the most commonly used language in hong kong , macau and among some overseas chinese communities , whereas southern min has been accepted in taiwan as an important local language along with mandarin .
meanwhile , begin 's government provided incentives for israelis to settle in the occupied west bank , increasing friction with the palestinians in that area . the basic law : jerusalem , the capital of israel , passed in 1980 , was believed by some to reaffirm israel 's 1967 annexation of jerusalem by government decree , and reignited international controversy over the status of the city . no israeli legislation has defined the territory of israel and no act specifically included east jerusalem therein . the position of the majority of un member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by israel to settle its citizens in the west bank , and impose its laws and administration on east jerusalem , are illegal and have no validity . in 1981 israel annexed the golan heights , although annexation was not recognized internationally .
the head of state of delhi is the lieutenant governor of the union territory of delhi , appointed by the president of india on the advice of the central government and the post is largely ceremonial , as the chief minister of the union territory of delhi is the head of government and is vested with most of the executive powers . according to the indian constitution , if a law passed by delhi 's legislative assembly is repugnant to any law passed by the parliament of india , then the law enacted by the parliament will prevail over the law enacted by the assembly .
although public opinion in paris was strongly against any form of surrender or concession to the prussians , the government realised that it could not hold the city for much longer , and that gambetta 's provincial armies would probably never break through to relieve paris . president trochu resigned on 25 january and was replaced by favre , who signed the surrender two days later at versailles , with the armistice coming into effect at midnight . several sources claim that in his carriage on the way back to paris , favre broke into tears , and collapsed into his daughter 's arms as the guns around paris fell silent at midnight . at tours , gambetta received word from paris on 30 january that the government had surrendered . furious , he refused to surrender and launched an immediate attack on german forces at orleans which , predictably , failed . a delegation of parisian diplomats arrived in tours by train on 5 february to negotiate with gambetta , and the following day gambetta stepped down and surrendered control of the provincial armies to the government of national defence , which promptly ordered a cease-fire across france .

a number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game . the maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three , though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches . common reasons for a substitution include injury , tiredness , ineffectiveness , a tactical switch , or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game . in standard adult matches , a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match . ifab recommends " that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team . " any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations .
the name thuringia or thüringen derives from the germanic tribe thuringii , who emerged during the migration period . their origin is not completely known . an older theory claimed that they were successors of the hermunduri , but later research rejected the idea . other historians argue that the thuringians were allies of the huns , came to central europe together with them , and lived before in what is galicia today . publius flavius vegetius renatus first mentioned the thuringii around 400 ; during that period , the thuringii were famous for their excellent horses .
most electrification systems use overhead wires , but third rail is an option up to about 1,200 v. third rail systems exclusively use dc distribution . the use of ac is not feasible because the dimensions of a third rail are physically very large compared with the skin depth that the alternating current penetrates to ( 0.3 millimetres or 0.012 inches ) in a steel rail ) . this effect makes the resistance per unit length unacceptably high compared with the use of dc . third rail is more compact than overhead wires and can be used in smaller-diameter tunnels , an important factor for subway systems .

during his term as praetor in the iberian peninsula ( modern portugal and spain ) , pompey 's contemporary julius caesar defeated two local tribes in battle . after his term as consul in 59 bc , he was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular governor of cisalpine gaul ( part of current northern italy ) , transalpine gaul ( current southern france ) and illyria ( part of the modern balkans ) . not content with an idle governorship , caesar strove to find reason to invade gaul ( modern france and belgium ) , which would give him the dramatic military success he sought . when two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near ( not into ) the roman province of transalpine gaul , caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his gallic wars , fought between 58 bc and 49 bc .
10th street ( 40°44′03″n 74°00′11″w﻿ / ﻿40.7342580°n 74.0029670°w﻿ / 40.7342580 ; -74.0029670 ) begins at the fdr drive and avenue c. west of sixth avenue , it turns southward about 40 degrees to join the greenwich village street grid and continue to west street on the hudson river . because west 4th street turns northward at sixth avenue , it intersects 10th , 11th and 12th and 13th streets in the west village . the m8 bus operates on 10th street in both directions between avenue d and avenue a , and eastbound between west street and sixth avenue . 10th street has an eastbound bike lane from west street to the east river . in 2009 , the two-way section of 10th street between avenue a and the east river had bicycle markings and sharrows installed , but it still has no dedicated bike lane . west 10th street was previously named amos street for richard amos . the end of west 10th street toward the hudson river was once the home of newgate prison , new york city 's first prison and the united states ' second .
generally , the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages , or between those languages and a third one , the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them . however , due to shifts in ecological niches of words , a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language . for example , the english actual should not be confused with the cognate french actuel ( " present " , " current " ) , the polish aktualny ( " present " , " current , " " topical , " " timely , " " feasible " ) , the swedish aktuell ( " topical " , " presently of importance " ) , the russian актуальный ( " urgent " , " topical " ) or the dutch actueel .
excessive devotion and enthusiasm in religious observance were superstitio , in the sense of " doing or believing more than was necessary " , to which women and foreigners were considered particularly prone . the boundaries between religio and superstitio are perhaps indefinite . the famous tirade of lucretius , the epicurean rationalist , against what is usually translated as " superstition " was in fact aimed at excessive religio . roman religion was based on knowledge rather than faith , but superstitio was viewed as an " inappropriate desire for knowledge " ; in effect , an abuse of religio .
another recent environmental issue in melbourne was the victorian government project of channel deepening melbourne ports by dredging port phillip bay—the port phillip channel deepening project . it was subject to controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could be affected by the disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments . other major pollution problems in melbourne include levels of bacteria including e. coli in the yarra river and its tributaries caused by septic systems , as well as litter . up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day . several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution . in february 2010 , the transition decade , an initiative to transition human society , economics and environment towards sustainability , was launched in melbourne .
modern treaties , regardless of subject matter , usually contain articles governing where the final authentic copies of the treaty will be deposited and how any subsequent disputes as to their interpretation will be peacefully resolved .
in indian philosophy , yoga is among other things , the name of one of the six āstika philosophical schools . the yoga philosophical system is closely allied with the dualism premises of samkhya school . the yoga school accepts the samkhya psychology and metaphysics , but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of " personal god " , unlike samkhya . the epistemology of the yoga school , like the sāmkhya school , relies on three of six prāmaṇas as the means of gaining reliable knowledge : pratyakṣa ( perception ) , anumāṇa ( inference ) and śabda ( āptavacana , word/testimony of reliable sources ) .
studies of nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments , as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all material excreted and eliminated from the body ( in urine and feces ) . comparing the food to the waste can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized in the body . the effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period , during which all food and waste must be analyzed . the number of variables involved in such experiments is high , making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive , which explains why the science of animal nutrition is still slowly evolving .
transport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the mayor of london , however the mayor 's financial control does not extend to the longer distance rail network that enters london . in 2007 he assumed responsibility for some local lines , which now form the london overground network , adding to the existing responsibility for the london underground , trams and buses . the public transport network is administered by transport for london ( tfl ) and is one of the most extensive in the world .
chinese political philosophy dates back to the spring and autumn period , specifically with confucius in the 6th century bc . chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the spring and autumn period and the warring states period . the major philosophies during the period , confucianism , legalism , mohism , agrarianism and taoism , each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools . philosophers such as confucius , mencius , and mozi , focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies . confucianism advocated a hierarchical , meritocratic government based on empathy , loyalty , and interpersonal relationships . legalism advocated a highly authoritarian government based on draconian punishments and laws . mohism advocated a communal , decentralized government centered on frugality and ascetism . the agrarians advocated a peasant utopian communalism and egalitarianism . taoism advocated a proto-anarchism . legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the qin dynasty , but was replaced by state confucianism in the han dynasty . prior to china 's adoption of communism , state confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of china up to the 20th century .
the nationalization announcement was greeted very emotionally by the audience and , throughout the arab world , thousands entered the streets shouting slogans of support . us ambassador henry a. byroade stated , " i can not overemphasize [ the ] popularity of the canal company nationalization within egypt , even among nasser 's enemies . " egyptian political scientist mahmoud hamad wrote that , prior to 1956 , nasser had consolidated control over egypt 's military and civilian bureaucracies , but it was only after the canal 's nationalization that he gained near-total popular legitimacy and firmly established himself as the " charismatic leader " and " spokesman for the masses not only in egypt , but all over the third world " . according to aburish , this was nasser 's largest pan-arab triumph at the time and " soon his pictures were to be found in the tents of yemen , the souks of marrakesh , and the posh villas of syria " . the official reason given for the nationalization was that funds from the canal would be used for the construction of the dam in aswan . that same day , egypt closed the canal to israeli shipping .
who recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed . continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function . in contrast , children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly . a child should also continue to be breastfed . the who states " food should never be withheld and the child 's usual foods should not be diluted . breastfeeding should always be continued . " and in the specific example of cholera , cdc also makes the same recommendation . in young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world , a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery .
this problem was compounded when the main hanoverian army under cumberland was defeated at the battle of hastenbeck and forced to surrender entirely at the convention of klosterzeven following a french invasion of hanover . the convention removed hanover and brunswick from the war , leaving the western approach to prussian territory extremely vulnerable . frederick sent urgent requests to britain for more substantial assistance , as he was now without any outside military support for his forces in germany .
spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management . it is the single best test for asthma . if the fev1 measured by this technique improves more than 12 % following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol , this is supportive of the diagnosis . it however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma , not currently acting up . as caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma , the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results . single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from copd . it is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person 's asthma is controlled .
in 1845 , ireland was hit by a potato blight . in the next four years over a million irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the great famine . in ireland , victoria was labelled " the famine queen " . she personally donated £2,000 to famine relief , more than any other individual donor , and also supported the maynooth grant to a roman catholic seminary in ireland , despite protestant opposition . the story that she donated only £5 in aid to the irish , and on the same day gave the same amount to battersea dogs home , was a myth generated towards the end of the 19th century .
the primary site of infection in the lungs , known as the " ghon focus " , is generally located in either the upper part of the lower lobe , or the lower part of the upper lobe . tuberculosis of the lungs may also occur via infection from the blood stream . this is known as a simon focus and is typically found in the top of the lung . this hematogenous transmission can also spread infection to more distant sites , such as peripheral lymph nodes , the kidneys , the brain , and the bones . all parts of the body can be affected by the disease , though for unknown reasons it rarely affects the heart , skeletal muscles , pancreas , or thyroid .
in june 2014 , state broadcaster china central television ( cctv ) broadcast a news story further characterizing windows 8 as a threat to national security . the story featured an interview with ni guangnan , who stated that operating systems could aggregate " sensitive user information " that could be used to " understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society " , and alleged that per documents leaked by edward snowden , the u.s. government had worked with microsoft to retrieve encrypted information . yang min , a computer scientist at fudan university , also stated that " the security features of windows 8 are basically to the benefit of microsoft , allowing them control of the users ' data , and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security . " microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the chinese social network sina weibo , which stated that the company had never " assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients " or provided client data to the u.s. government , never " provided any government the authority to directly visit " or placed any backdoors in its products and services , and that it had never concealed government requests for client data .
the most popular alcoholic drink in switzerland is wine . switzerland is notable for the variety of grapes grown because of the large variations in terroirs , with their specific mixes of soil , air , altitude and light . swiss wine is produced mainly in valais , vaud ( lavaux ) , geneva and ticino , with a small majority of white wines . vineyards have been cultivated in switzerland since the roman era , even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin . the most widespread varieties are the chasselas ( called fendant in valais ) and pinot noir . the merlot is the main variety produced in ticino .
in the audition rounds , 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions . these were cut to 30 for the semifinal , with ten going on to the finals . one semifinalist , delano cagnolatti , was disqualified for lying to evade the show 's age limit . one of the early favorites , tamyra gray , was eliminated at the top four , the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons . christina christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations , and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital . jim verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show ; his sexual orientation was revealed in his online journal , however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes .
bush 's margin of victory in the popular vote was the smallest ever for a reelected incumbent president , but marked the first time since his father 's victory 16 years prior that a candidate won a majority of the popular vote . the electoral map closely resembled that of 2000 , with only three states changing sides : new mexico and iowa voted republican in 2004 after having voted democratic in 2000 , while new hampshire voted democratic in 2004 after previously voting republican . in the electoral college , bush received 286 votes to kerry 's 252 .
court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of edward vii . these young women were known as débutantes , and the occasion—termed their " coming out " —represented their first entrée into society . débutantes wore full court dress , with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair . they entered , curtsied , and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy , while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length . ( the ceremony , known as an evening court , corresponded to the " court drawing rooms " of victoria 's reign . ) after world war ii , the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions , usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress .
pope saint john xxiii ( latin : ioannes xxiii ; italian : giovanni xxiii ) born angelo giuseppe roncalli , [ a ] italian pronunciation : [ ˈandʒelo dʒuˈzɛppe roŋˈkalli ] ; 25 november 1881 – 3 june 1963 ) reigned as pope from 28 october 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 april 2014 . angelo giuseppe roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in lombardy . he was ordained to the priesthood on 10 august 1904 and served in a number of posts , including papal nuncio in france and a delegate to bulgaria , greece and turkey . in a consistory on 12 january 1953 pope pius xii made roncalli a cardinal as the cardinal-priest of santa prisca in addition to naming him as the patriarch of venice .
arguing against the absolutist position , leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity . these arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy : the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles . the principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact , there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise . the identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart , then they are one and the same thing .
banking services are provided by the national bank of tuvalu . public sector workers make up about 65 % of those formally employed . remittances from tuvaluans living in australia and new zealand , and remittances from tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships are important sources of income for tuvaluans . approximately 15 % of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships . agriculture in tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table . tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing .

the release of a video-game starpower : beyoncé was cancelled after beyoncé pulled out of a $ 100 million with gatefive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development . it was settled out of court by her lawyers in june 2013 who said that they had cancelled because gatefive had lost its financial backers . beyoncé also has had deals with american express , nintendo ds and l'oréal since the age of 18 .
the government of india is based on a tiered system , in which the constitution of india delineates the subjects on which each tier of government has executive powers . the constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government , the union government ( also known as the central government ) , representing the union of india , and the state governments . later , a third tier was added in the form of panchayats and municipalities . in the current arrangement , the seventh schedule of the indian constitution delimits the subjects of each level of governmental jurisdiction , dividing them into three lists :
islington 's 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) long upper street , extending northwards from angel , has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the united kingdom . europe 's busiest shopping area is oxford street , a shopping street nearly 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) long , making it the longest shopping street in the united kingdom . oxford street is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores , including the world-famous selfridges flagship store . knightsbridge , home to the equally renowned harrods department store , lies to the south-west .
similar organizations in other countries followed : the american anthropological association in 1902 , the anthropological society of madrid ( 1865 ) , the anthropological society of vienna ( 1870 ) , the italian society of anthropology and ethnology ( 1871 ) , and many others subsequently . the majority of these were evolutionist . one notable exception was the berlin society of anthropology ( 1869 ) founded by rudolph virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists . not religious himself , he insisted that darwin 's conclusions lacked empirical foundation .
charleston is known for its unique culture , which blends traditional southern u.s. , english , french , and west african elements . the downtown peninsula has gained a reputation for its art , music , local cuisine , and fashion . spoleto festival usa , held annually in late spring , has become one of the world 's major performing arts festivals . it was founded in 1977 by pulitzer prize-winning composer gian carlo menotti , who sought to establish a counterpart to the festival dei due mondi ( the festival of two worlds ) in spoleto , italy .
an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen . the process also produces alumina , but the expensive gallium , which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets , can be re-used . this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy , as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported .
the late turrell v. wylie , a former professor of the university of washington , and li tieh-tseng argue that the reliability of the heavily censored history of ming as a credible source on sino-tibetan relations is questionable , in the light of modern scholarship . other historians also assert that these ming titles were nominal and did not actually confer the authority that the earlier yuan titles had . van praag writes that the " numerous economically motivated tibetan missions to the ming court are referred to as 'tributary missions ' in the ming shih . " van praag writes that these " tributary missions " were simply prompted by china 's need for horses from tibet , since a viable horse market in mongol lands was closed as a result of incessant conflict . morris rossabi also writes that " tibet , which had extensive contacts with china during the yuan , scarcely had diplomatic relations with the ming . "
though decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean , it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business , as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 u.s. vs. paramount pictures , et al . decision . leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose , and in 1950 mca agent lew wasserman made a deal with universal for his client james stewart that would change the rules of the business . wasserman 's deal gave stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary . when one of those films , winchester '73 , proved to be a hit , the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at universal , and eventually at other studios as well .
tennessee is known as the " volunteer state " , a nickname some claimed was earned during the war of 1812 because of the prominent role played by volunteer soldiers from tennessee , especially during the battle of new orleans . other sources differ on the origin of the state nickname ; according to the columbia encyclopedia , the name refers to volunteers for the mexican–american war . this explanation is more likely , because president polk 's call for 2,600 nationwide volunteers at the beginning of the mexican-american war resulted in 30,000 volunteers from tennessee alone , largely in response to the death of davy crockett and appeals by former tennessee governor and now texas politician , sam houston .
spectre was released on 26 october 2015 in the united kingdom on the same night as the world premiere at the royal albert hall in london , followed by a worldwide release . it was released in the united states on 6 november 2015 . it became the second james bond film to be screened in imax venues after skyfall , although it was not filmed with imax cameras . spectre received mixed reviews upon its release ; although criticised for its length , lack of screen time for new characters , and writing , it received praise for its action sequences and cinematography . the theme song , " writing 's on the wall " , received mixed reviews , particularly compared to the previous theme ; nevertheless , it won the golden globe for best original song and was nominated for the academy award in the same category . as of 20 february 2016 [ update ] , spectre has grossed over $ 879 million worldwide .
the performance of " summertime " by barrino , later known simply as " fantasia " , at top 8 was widely praised , and simon cowell considered it as his favorite idol moment in the nine seasons he was on the show . fantasia and diana degarmo were the last two finalists , and fantasia was crowned as the winner . fantasia released as her coronation single " i believe " , a song co-written by season one finalist tamyra gray , and degarmo released " dreams " . fantasia went on to gain some successes as a recording artist , while hudson , who placed seventh , became the only idol contestant so far to win both an academy award and a grammy .
not a lot of empirical work on the practices of inter/transnational information and intelligence sharing has been undertaken . a notable exception is james sheptycki 's study of police cooperation in the english channel region ( 2002 ) , which provides a systematic content analysis of information exchange files and a description of how these transnational information and intelligence exchanges are transformed into police case-work . the study showed that transnational police information sharing was routinized in the cross-channel region from 1968 on the basis of agreements directly between the police agencies and without any formal agreement between the countries concerned . by 1992 , with the signing of the schengen treaty , which formalized aspects of police information exchange across the territory of the european union , there were worries that much , if not all , of this intelligence sharing was opaque , raising questions about the efficacy of the accountability mechanisms governing police information sharing in europe ( joubert and bevers , 1996 ) .
some christians argue that the earliest source of political federalism ( or federalism in human institutions ; in contrast to theological federalism ) is the ecclesiastical federalism found in the bible . they point to the structure of the early christian church as described ( and prescribed , as believed by many ) in the new testament . in their arguments , this is particularly demonstrated in the council of jerusalem , described in acts chapter 15 , where the apostles and elders gathered together to govern the church ; the apostles being representatives of the universal church , and elders being such for the local church . to this day , elements of federalism can be found in almost every christian denomination , some more than others .
tajikistan ( i/tɑːˈdʒiːkᵻstɑːn/ , /təˈdʒiːkᵻstæn/ , or /tæˈdʒiːkiːstæn/ ; persian : تاجيكستان‎‎ тоҷикистон [ tɔd͡ʒikɪsˈtɔn ] ) , officially the republic of tajikistan ( persian : جمهورى تاجيكستان‎‎ tajik : ҷумҳурии тоҷикистон , çumhuriji toçikiston/jumhuriyi tojikiston ; russian : респу́блика таджикистан , respublika tadzhikistan ) , is a mountainous , landlocked country in central asia with an estimated 8 million people in 2013 , and an area of 143,100 km2 ( 55,300 sq mi ) . it is bordered by afghanistan to the south , uzbekistan to the west , kyrgyzstan to the north , and china to the east . pakistan lies to the south , separated by the narrow wakhan corridor . traditional homelands of tajik people included present-day tajikistan , afghanistan and uzbekistan .
energy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum , where it can be weighed . it is also equivalent to mass , and this mass is always associated with it . mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy , and likewise always appears associated with it , as described in mass-energy equivalence . the formula e = mc² , derived by albert einstein ( 1905 ) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity . in different theoretical frameworks , similar formulas were derived by j. j. thomson ( 1881 ) , henri poincaré ( 1900 ) , friedrich hasenöhrl ( 1904 ) and others ( see mass-energy equivalence # history for further information ) .
militarization was another aspect of the soviet state . large parts of the country , especially the coastal areas , were closed to all but the soviet military . most of the sea shore and all sea islands ( including saaremaa and hiiumaa ) were declared " border zones " . people not actually residing there were restricted from travelling to them without a permit . a notable closed military installation was the city of paldiski , which was entirely closed to all public access . the city had a support base for the soviet baltic fleet 's submarines and several large military bases , including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors . the paldiski reactors building passed into estonian control in 1994 after the last russian troops left the country . immigration was another effect of soviet occupation . hundreds of thousands of migrants were relocated to estonia from other parts of the soviet union to assist industrialisation and militarisation , contributing an increase of about half a million people within 45 years .
on 1 november 2013 , international postal services for somalia officially resumed . the universal postal union is now assisting the somali postal service to develop its capacity , including providing technical assistance and basic mail processing equipment .
although england 's first away kits were blue , england 's traditional away colours are red shirts , white shorts and red socks . in 1996 , england 's away kit was changed to grey shirts , shorts and socks . this kit was only worn three times , including against germany in the semi-final of euro 96 but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the england away kit remained red until 2011 , when a navy blue away kit was introduced . the away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches , when a new edition has been released to promote it .
gellius says that in his day humanitas is commonly used as a synonym for philanthropy – or kindness and benevolence toward one 's fellow human being . gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong , and that model writers of latin , such as cicero and others , used the word only to mean what we might call " humane " or " polite " learning , or the greek equivalent paideia . gellius became a favorite author in the italian renaissance , and , in fifteenth-century italy , teachers and scholars of philosophy , poetry , and rhetoric were called and called themselves " humanists " . modern scholars , however , point out that cicero ( 106 – 43 bce ) , who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term humanitas , in fact frequently used the word in both senses , as did his near contemporaries . for cicero , a lawyer , what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech , which , allied to reason , could ( and should ) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law . thus humanitas included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative , humanism , which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to scholarship .
with a total area of 42.7 km2 ( 16.5 sq mi ) , new delhi forms a small part of the delhi metropolitan area . because the city is located on the indo-gangetic plain , there is little difference in elevation across the city . new delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the aravalli range ; all that is left of those mountains is the delhi ridge , which is also called the lungs of delhi . while new delhi lies on the floodplains of the yamuna river , it is essentially a landlocked city . east of the river is the urban area of shahdara . new delhi falls under the seismic zone-iv , making it vulnerable to earthquakes .
in his harvard " lectures on pragmatism " ( 1903 ) , peirce enumerated what he called the " three cotary propositions of pragmatism " ( l : cos , cotis whetstone ) , saying that they " put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism " . first among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above , but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street . that is , it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses . hence , if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses , and perception itself can be seen as a species of abductive inference , its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique – in a word , incorrigible . this in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts , since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or " thisness " – what the scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction . scientific concepts , on the other hand , are general in nature , and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them . this notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , most recently for instance with the work of irvin rock on indirect perception .
according to a 2011 projection by the international energy agency , solar power plants may produce most of the world 's electricity within 50 years , significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment . the iea has said : " photovoltaic and solar-thermal plants may meet most of the world 's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind , hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation " . " photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity " .
in process known as the marian reforms , roman consul gaius marius carried out a programme of reform of the roman military . in 107 bc , all citizens , regardless of their wealth or social class , were made eligible for entry into the roman army . this move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries , of removing property requirements for military service . the distinction between the three heavy infantry classes , which had already become blurred , had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry . the heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock , while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry . the army 's higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the roman aristocracy .
some usb devices require more power than is permitted by the specifications for a single port . this is common for external hard and optical disc drives , and generally for devices with motors or lamps . such devices can use an external power supply , which is allowed by the standard , or use a dual-input usb cable , one input of which is used for power and data transfer , the other solely for power , which makes the device a non-standard usb device . some usb ports and external hubs can , in practice , supply more power to usb devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this .

rawski writes that altan khan 's conversion to the gelug " can be interpreted as an attempt to expand his authority in his conflict with his nominal superior , tümen khan . " to further cement the mongol-tibetan alliance , the great-grandson of altan khan—the 4th dalai lama ( 1589–1616 ) —was made the fourth dalai lama . in 1642 , the 5th dalai lama ( 1617–1682 ) became the first to wield effective political control over tibet .
the development of flattop vessels produced the first large fleet ships . in 1918 , hms argus became the world 's first carrier capable of launching and recovering naval aircraft . as a result of the washington naval treaty of 1922 , which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships , most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down ( or had served ) as different ship types : cargo ships , cruisers , battlecruisers , or battleships . these conversions gave rise to the lexington-class aircraft carriers ( 1927 ) , akagi and courageous class . specialist carrier evolution was well underway , with several navies ordering and building warships that were purposefully designed to function as aircraft carriers by the mid-1920s , resulting in the commissioning of ships such as hōshō ( 1922 ) , hms hermes ( 1924 ) , and béarn ( 1927 ) . during world war ii , these ships would become known as fleet carriers .

the creation of modern-day eritrea is a result of the incorporation of independent , distinct kingdoms and sultanates ( for example , medri bahri and the sultanate of aussa ) eventually resulting in the formation of italian eritrea . in 1947 eritrea became part of a federation with ethiopia , the federation of ethiopia and eritrea . subsequent annexation into ethiopia led to the eritrean war of independence , ending with eritrean independence following a referendum in april 1993 . hostilities between eritrea and ethiopia persisted , leading to the eritrean–ethiopian war of 1998–2000 and further skirmishes with both djibouti and ethiopia .
at the outset of the korean war the cia still only had a few thousand employees , a thousand of whom worked in analysis . intelligence primarily came from the office of reports and estimates , which drew its reports from a daily take of state department telegrams , military dispatches , and other public documents . the cia still lacked its own intelligence gathering abilities . on 21 august 1950 , shortly after the invasion of south korea , truman announced walter bedell smith as the new director of the cia to correct what was seen as a grave failure of intelligence .

the term hokkien ( 福建 ; hɔk˥˥kɪɛn˨˩ ) is itself a term not used in chinese to refer to the dialect , as it simply means fujian province . in chinese linguistics , these dialects are known by their classification under the quanzhang division ( chinese : 泉漳片 ; pinyin : quánzhāng piàn ) of min nan , which comes from the first characters of the two main hokkien urban centers quanzhou and zhangzhou . the variety is also known by other terms such as the more general min nan ( traditional chinese : 閩南語 , 閩南話 ; simplified chinese : 闽南语 , 闽南话 ; pinyin : mǐnnányǔ , mǐnnánhuà ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : bân-lâm-gí , bân-lâm-oē ) or southern min , and fulaohua ( traditional chinese : 福佬話 ; simplified chinese : 福佬话 ; pinyin : fúlǎohuà ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : hō-ló-oē ) . the term hokkien ( chinese : 福建話 ; pe̍h-ōe-jī : hok-kiàn oē ; tâi-lô : hok-kiàn-uē ) , on the other hand , is used commonly in south east asia to refer to min-nan dialects .
according to an autosomal dna study by hodgson et al . ( 2014 ) , the afro-asiatic languages were likely spread across africa and the near east by an ancestral population ( s ) carrying a newly identified non-african genetic component , which the researchers dub the " ethio-somali " . this ethio-somali component is today most common among afro-asiatic-speaking populations in the horn of africa . it reaches a frequency peak among ethnic somalis , representing the majority of their ancestry . the ethio-somali component is most closely related to the maghrebi non-african genetic component , and is believed to have diverged from all other non-african ancestries at least 23,000 years ago . on this basis , the researchers suggest that the original ethio-somali carrying population ( s ) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the near east , having crossed over into northeastern africa via the sinai peninsula . the population then likely split into two branches , with one group heading westward toward the maghreb and the other moving south into the horn .
industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas , and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water . most hydrogen is employed near its production site , with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing ( e.g. , hydrocracking ) and ammonia production , mostly for the fertilizer market . hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .
hopkins school , a private school , was founded in 1660 and is the fifth-oldest educational institution in the united states . new haven is home to a number of other private schools as well as public magnet schools , including metropolitan business academy , high school in the community , hill regional career high school , co-op high school , new haven academy , aces educational center for the arts , the foote school and the sound school , all of which draw students from new haven and suburban towns . new haven is also home to two achievement first charter schools , amistad academy and elm city college prep , and to common ground , an environmental charter school .
in february 1918 , he was appointed officer in charge of boys at the royal naval air service 's training establishment at cranwell . with the establishment of the royal air force two months later and the transfer of cranwell from navy to air force control , he transferred from the royal navy to the royal air force . he was appointed officer commanding number 4 squadron of the boys ' wing at cranwell until august 1918 , before reporting to the raf 's cadet school at st leonards-on-sea where he completed a fortnight 's training and took command of a squadron on the cadet wing . he was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot . during the closing weeks of the war , he served on the staff of the raf 's independent air force at its headquarters in nancy , france . following the disbanding of the independent air force in november 1918 , he remained on the continent for two months as a staff officer with the royal air force until posted back to britain . he accompanied the belgian monarch king albert on his triumphal reentry into brussels on 22 november . prince albert qualified as an raf pilot on 31 july 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day .
the timing of puberty can have important psychological and social consequences . early maturing boys are usually taller and stronger than their friends . they have the advantage in capturing the attention of potential partners and in becoming hand-picked for sports . pubescent boys often tend to have a good body image , are more confident , secure , and more independent . late maturing boys can be less confident because of poor body image when comparing themselves to already developed friends and peers . however , early puberty is not always positive for boys ; early sexual maturation in boys can be accompanied by increased aggressiveness due to the surge of hormones that affect them . because they appear older than their peers , pubescent boys may face increased social pressure to conform to adult norms ; society may view them as more emotionally advanced , despite the fact that their cognitive and social development may lag behind their appearance . studies have shown that early maturing boys are more likely to be sexually active and are more likely to participate in risky behaviors .
in 1982 and 1987 , harrison and harrison enlarged the organ under the direction of the then abbey organist simon preston to include an additional lower choir organ and a bombarde organ : the current instrument now has five manuals and 109 speaking stops . in 2006 , the console of the organ was refurbished by harrison and harrison , and space was prepared for two additional 16 ft stops on the lower choir organ and the bombarde organ . one part of the instrument , the celestial organ , is currently not connected or playable .
despite its tropical wet and dry climate , extensive irrigation makes it a rich agricultural region . its canal-irrigation system established by the british is the largest in the world . wheat and cotton are the largest crops . other crops include rice , sugarcane , millet , corn , oilseeds , pulses , vegetables , and fruits such as kinoo . livestock and poultry production are also important . despite past animosities , the rural masses in punjab 's farms continue to use the hindu calendar for planting and harvesting .
saint-barthélemy ( french : saint-barthélemy , french pronunciation : ​ [ sɛ̃baʁtelemi ] ) , officially the territorial collectivity of saint-barthélemy ( french : collectivité territoriale de saint-barthélemy ) , is an overseas collectivity of france . often abbreviated to saint-barth in french , or st. barts or st. barths in english , the indigenous people called the island ouanalao . st. barthélemy lies about 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) southeast of st. martin and north of st. kitts . puerto rico is 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) to the west in the greater antilles .
on 23 november 1991 , in a prepared statement made on his deathbed , mercury confirmed that he had aids . within 24 hours of the statement , he died of bronchial pneumonia , which was brought on as a complication of aids . his funeral service on 27 november in kensal green , west london was private , and held in accordance with the zoroastrian religious faith of his family . " bohemian rhapsody " was re-released as a single shortly after mercury 's death , with " these are the days of our lives " as the double a-side . the music video for " these are the days of our lives " contains mercury 's final scenes in front of the camera . the single went to number one in the uk , remaining there for five weeks – the only recording to top the christmas chart twice and the only one to be number one in four different years ( 1975 , 1976 , 1991 , and 1992 ) . initial proceeds from the single – approximately £1,000,000 – were donated to the terrence higgins trust .
the bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a lipid , cytoplasmic or plasma membrane ) . this membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . as they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane-bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . they lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , chloroplasts and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . bacteria were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the prokaryotic cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . these subcellular levels of organization have been called " bacterial hyperstructures " .
inspection service is designed to provide access to the hoistway and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics . it is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'inspection ' , 'car top ' , 'access enable ' or 'hwenab ' . when this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving , car calls will be canceled ( and the buttons disabled ) , and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group ( or canceled in a single elevator configuration ) . the elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'access ' key switches , usually located at the highest ( to access the top of the car ) and lowest ( to access the elevator pit ) landings . the access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the hoistway door open . this speed can range from anywhere up to 60 % of normal operating speed on most controllers , and is usually defined by local safety codes .
in the early 5th century , the deep crisis suffered by the roman empire allowed different tribes of central europe ( suebi , vandals and alani ) to cross the rhine and penetrate into the rule on 31 december 406 . its progress towards the iberian peninsula forced the roman authorities to establish a treaty ( foedus ) by which the suebi would settle peacefully and govern galicia as imperial allies . so , from 409 galicia was taken by the suebi , forming the first medieval kingdom to be created in europe , in 411 , even before the fall of the roman empire , being also the first germanic kingdom to mint coinage in roman lands . during this period a briton colony and bishopric ( see mailoc ) was established in northern galicia ( britonia ) , probably as foederati and allies of the suebi . in 585 , the visigothic king leovigild invaded the suebic kingdom of galicia and defeated it , bringing it under visigoth control .
drawing from his own experiences in scouting , spielberg helped the boy scouts of america develop a merit badge in cinematography in order to help promote filmmaking as a marketable skill . the badge was launched at the 1989 national scout jamboree , which spielberg attended , and where he personally counseled many boys in their work on requirements . that same year , 1989 , saw the release of indiana jones and the last crusade . the opening scene shows a teenage indiana jones in scout uniform bearing the rank of a life scout . spielberg stated he made indiana jones a boy scout in honor of his experience in scouting . for his career accomplishments , service to others , and dedication to a new merit badge spielberg was awarded the distinguished eagle scout award .
a brief shoot at london 's city hall was filmed on 18 april 2015 , while mendes was on location . on 17 may 2015 filming took place on the thames in london . stunt scenes involving craig and seydoux on a speedboat as well as a low flying helicopter near westminster bridge were shot at night , with filming temporarily closing both westminster and lambeth bridges . scenes were also shot on the river near mi6 's headquarters at vauxhall cross . the crew returned to the river less than a week later to film scenes solely set on westminster bridge . the london fire brigade was on set to simulate rain as well as monitor smoke used for filming . craig , seydoux , and waltz , as well as harris and fiennes , were seen being filmed . prior to this , scenes involving fiennes were shot at a restaurant in covent garden . filming then took place in trafalgar square . in early june , the crew , as well as craig , seydoux , and waltz , returned to the thames for a final time to continue filming scenes previously shot on the river .
she has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with destiny 's child and her solo efforts . her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like " independent women " and " survivor " , but after the start of her relationship with jay z she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as " cater 2 u " . beyoncé has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved , especially during her solo efforts . however , she does not formulate beats herself , but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production , sharing them with producers .
grazing organisms may also kill their prey species , but this is seldom the case . while some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore , by the individualized nature of the organism , kill their prey , many only eat a small part of the plant . grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots , but most is simply grazed upon , allowing the plant to regrow once again . kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests , but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure . animals may also be 'grazed ' upon ; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring . starfish may be grazed on , being capable of regenerating lost arms .
in the united states , " cultural studies " focuses largely on the study of popular culture , that is , on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods . richard hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the birmingham centre for contemporary cultural studies or cccs . it has since become strongly associated with stuart hall , who succeeded hoggart as director . cultural studies in this sense , then , can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism , which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as " western civilization " or as " globalism . "
the world 's largest deposit of natural bitumen , known as the athabasca oil sands is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta . this formation is from the early cretaceous , and is composed of numerous lenses of oil-bearing sand with up to 20 % oil . isotopic studies attribute the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old . two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands , to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands , respectively . of the alberta bitumen deposits , only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining . the other 80 % has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam-assisted gravity drainage .
the word " dollar " is one of the words in the first paragraph of section 9 of article 1 of the u.s. constitution . in that context , " dollars " is a reference to the spanish milled dollar , a coin that had a monetary value of 8 spanish units of currency , or reales . in 1792 the u.s. congress adopted legislation titled an act establishing a mint , and regulating the coins of the united states . section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins , including " dollars or units—each to be of the value of a spanish milled dollar as the same is now current , and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure , or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver " . section 20 of the act provided , " that the money of account of the united states shall be expressed in dollars , or units ... and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the united states shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation " . in other words , this act designated the united states dollar as the unit of currency of the united states .
the soviets also helped germany to avoid british naval blockades by providing a submarine base , basis nord , in the northern soviet union near murmansk . this also provided a refueling and maintenance location , and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping . in addition , the soviets provided germany with access to the northern sea route for both cargo ships and raiders ( though only the commerce raider komet used the route before the german invasion ) , which forced britain to protect sea lanes in both the atlantic and the pacific .
the spanish empire and other europeans brought horses to the americas . some of these animals escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild . the re-introduction of the horse , extinct in the americas for over 7500 years , had a profound impact on native american culture in the great plains of north america and of patagonia in south america . by domesticating horses , some tribes had great success : horses enabled them to expand their territories , exchange more goods with neighboring tribes , and more easily capture game , especially bison .
damaged spots on a laserdisc can be played through or skipped over , while a dvd will often become unplayable past the damage . some newer dvd players feature a repair+skip algorithm , which alleviates this problem by continuing to play the disc , filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a frozen frame of the last readable image and sound . the success of this feature depends upon the amount of damage . laserdisc players , when working in full analog , recover from such errors faster than dvd players . direct comparison here is almost impossible due to the sheer size differences between the two media . a 1 in ( 3 cm ) scratch on a dvd will probably cause more problems than a 1 in ( 3 cm ) scratch on a laserdisc , but a fingerprint taking up 1 % of the area of a dvd would almost certainly cause fewer problems than a similar mark covering 1 % of the surface of a laserdisc .

one way to divide hunter-gatherer groups is by their return systems . james woodburn uses the categories " immediate return " hunter-gatherers for egalitarian and " delayed return " for nonegalitarian . immediate return foragers consume their food within a day or two after they procure it . delayed return foragers store the surplus food ( kelly , 31 ) .
the exact causes for the development of a particular sexual orientation have yet to be established . to date , a lot of research has been conducted to determine the influence of genetics , hormonal action , development dynamics , social and cultural influences—which has led many to think that biology and environment factors play a complex role in forming it . it was once thought that homosexuality was the result of faulty psychological development , resulting from childhood experiences and troubled relationships , including childhood sexual abuse . it has been found that this was based on prejudice and misinformation .
building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs ( shelter , security , worship , etc . ) and means ( available building materials and attendant skills ) . as human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices , building became a craft , and " architecture " is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft .
legendary princess bhrikuti ( 7th-century ) and artist araniko ( 1245 - 1306 ad ) from that tradition of kathmandu valley played a significant role in spreading buddhism in tibet and china . there are over 108 traditional monasteries ( bahals and bahis ) in kathmandu based on newar buddhism . since the 1960s , the permanent tibetan buddhist population of kathmandu has risen significantly so that there are now over fifty tibetan buddhist monasteries in the area . also , with the modernization of newar buddhism , various theravada bihars have been established .
as with the spoken languages , the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate , mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups , the persians and azerbaijanis , due to the lack of iranian state censuses based on ethnicity . the cia 's world factbook has estimated that around 79 % of the population of iran are a diverse indo-european ethno-linguistic group that comprise the speakers of iranian languages , with persians constituting 53 % of the population , gilaks and mazanderanis 7 % , kurds 10 % , lurs 6 % , and balochs 2 % . peoples of the other ethnicities in iran make up the remaining 22 % , with azerbaijanis constituting 16 % , arabs 2 % , turkmens and turkic tribes 2 % , and others 2 % ( such as armenians , talysh , georgians , circassians , assyrians ) .
cbc announced on april 4 , 2012 , that it will shut down all of its approximately 620 analogue television transmitters on july 31 , 2012 with no plans to install digital transmitters in their place , thus reducing the total number of the corporation 's television transmitters across the country down to 27 . according to the cbc , this would reduce the corporation 's yearly costs by $ 10 million . no plans have been announced to use subchannels to maintain over-the-air signals for both cbc and radio-canada in markets where the corporation has one digital transmitter . in fact , in its crtc application to shut down all of its analogue television transmitters , the cbc communicated its opposition to use of subchannels , citing costs , amongst other reasons .
some of the leading art groups of china are based in nanjing ; they include the qianxian dance company , nanjing dance company , jiangsu peking opera institute and nanjing xiaohonghua art company among others .
throughout the industrial revolution , plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port , handling imports and passengers from the americas , and exporting local minerals ( tin , copper , lime , china clay and arsenic ) while the neighbouring town of devonport became a strategic royal naval shipbuilding and dockyard town . in 1914 three neighbouring independent towns , viz. , the county borough of plymouth , the county borough of devonport , and the urban district of east stonehouse were merged to form a single county borough . the combined town took the name of plymouth which , in 1928 , achieved city status . the city 's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during world war ii , an act known as the plymouth blitz . after the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of plympton and plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967 .
the name ipod was proposed by vinnie chieco , a freelance copywriter , who ( with others ) was called by apple to figure out how to introduce the new player to the public . after chieco saw a prototype , he thought of the movie 2001 : a space odyssey and the phrase " open the pod bay door , hal ! " , which refers to the white eva pods of the discovery one spaceship . chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player . apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use . joseph n. grasso of new jersey had originally listed an " ipod " trademark with the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) in july 2000 for internet kiosks . the first ipod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in new jersey in march 1998 , and commercial use began in january 2000 , but had apparently been discontinued by 2001 . the trademark was registered by the uspto in november 2003 , and grasso assigned it to apple computer , inc. in 2005 .
modern greek cypriot literary figures include the poet and writer kostas montis , poet kyriakos charalambides , poet michalis pasiardis , writer nicos nicolaides , stylianos atteshlis , altheides , loukis akritas and demetris th . gotsis . dimitris lipertis , vasilis michaelides and pavlos liasides are folk poets who wrote poems mainly in the cypriot-greek dialect . among leading turkish cypriot writers are osman türkay , twice nominated for the nobel prize in literature , özker yaşın , neriman cahit , urkiye mine balman , mehmet yaşın and neşe yaşın .
the free officers ' intention was not to install themselves in government , but to re-establish a parliamentary democracy . nasser did not believe that a low-ranking officer like himself ( a lieutenant colonel ) would be accepted by the egyptian people , and so selected general naguib to be his " boss " and lead the coup in name . the revolution they had long sought was launched on 22 july and was declared a success the next day . the free officers seized control of all government buildings , radio stations , and police stations , as well as army headquarters in cairo . while many of the rebel officers were leading their units , nasser donned civilian clothing to avoid detection by royalists and moved around cairo monitoring the situation . in a move to stave off foreign intervention two days before the revolution , nasser had notified the american and british governments of his intentions , and both had agreed not to aid farouk . under pressure from the americans , nasser had agreed to exile the deposed king with an honorary ceremony .
independent city states were unable to compete with hellenistic kingdoms and were usually forced to ally themselves to one of them for defense , giving honors to hellenistic rulers in return for protection . one example is athens , which had been decisively defeated by antipater in the lamian war ( 323-322 ) and had its port in the piraeus garrisoned by macedonian troops who supported a conservative oligarchy . after demetrius poliorcetes captured athens in 307 and restored the democracy , the athenians honored him and his father antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king . athens later allied itself to ptolemaic egypt to throw off macedonian rule , eventually setting up a religious cult for the ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city phyles in honor of ptolemy for his aid against macedon . in spite of the ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors , athens and sparta were defeated by antigonus ii during the chremonidean war ( 267-61 ) . athens was then occupied by macedonian troops , and run by macedonian officials .
according to a forbes article written in 2013 employment in the " old north state " has gained many different industry sectors . see the following article summary : science , technology , energy and math , or stem , industries in the area surrounding north carolina 's capital have grown 17.9 percent since 2001 , placing raleigh-cary at no . 5 among the 51 largest metro areas in the country where technology is booming . in 2010 north carolina 's total gross state product was $ 424.9 billion , while the state debt in november 2012 , according to one source , totalled us $ 2.4bn , while according to another , was in 2012 us $ 57.8bn . in 2011 the civilian labor force was at around 4.5 million with employment near 4.1 million . the working population is employed across the major employment sectors . the economy of north carolina covers 15 metropolitan areas . in 2010 , north carolina was chosen as the third-best state for business by forbes magazine , and the second-best state by chief executive officer magazine .
southern europe 's most emblematic climate is that of the mediterranean climate , which has become a typically known characteristic of the area . the mediterranean climate covers much of portugal , spain , southeast france , italy , croatia , albania , montenegro , greece , the western and southern coastal regions of turkey as well as the mediterranean islands . those areas of mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout , including dry hills , small plains , pine forests and olive trees .
pal laserdiscs have a slightly longer playing time than ntsc discs , but have fewer audio options . pal discs only have two audio tracks , consisting of either two analog-only tracks on older pal lds , or two digital-only tracks on newer discs . in comparison , later ntsc lds are capable of carrying four tracks ( two analog and two digital ) . on certain releases , one of the analog tracks is used to carry a modulated ac-3 signal for 5.1 channel audio ( for decoding and playback by newer ld players with an " ac-3 rf " output ) . however , older ntsc lds made before 1984 ( such as the original discovision discs ) only have two analog audio tracks .
the prime minister is often , but not always , a member of parliament [ clarification needed ] and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature . in some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers ( known as the royal prerogative ) that are constitutionally vested in the crown and may be exercised without the approval of parliament .
the disadvantage of the ski-jump is the penalty it exacts on aircraft size , payload , and fuel load ( and thus range ) ; heavily laden aircraft can not launch using a ski-jump because their high loaded weight requires either a longer takeoff roll than is possible on a carrier deck , or assistance from a catapult or jato rocket . for example , the russian su-33 is only able to launch from the carrier admiral kuznetsov with a minimal armament and fuel load . another disadvantage is on mixed flight deck operations where helicopters are also present such as a us landing helicopter dock or landing helicopter assault amphibious assault ship a ski jump is not included as this would eliminate one or more helicopter landing areas , this flat deck limits the loading of harriers but is somewhat mitigated by the longer rolling start provided by a long flight deck compared to many stovl carriers .

on 17 march 1883 , she fell down some stairs at windsor , which left her lame until july ; she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter . brown died 10 days after her accident , and to the consternation of her private secretary , sir henry ponsonby , victoria began work on a eulogistic biography of brown . ponsonby and randall davidson , dean of windsor , who had both seen early drafts , advised victoria against publication , on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of a love affair . the manuscript was destroyed . in early 1884 , victoria did publish more leaves from a journal of a life in the highlands , a sequel to her earlier book , which she dedicated to her " devoted personal attendant and faithful friend john brown " . on the day after the first anniversary of brown 's death , victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son , leopold , had died in cannes . he was " the dearest of my dear sons " , she lamented . the following month , victoria 's youngest child , beatrice , met and fell in love with prince henry of battenberg at the wedding of victoria 's granddaughter princess victoria of hesse and by rhine to henry 's brother prince louis of battenberg . beatrice and henry planned to marry , but victoria opposed the match at first , wishing to keep beatrice at home to act as her companion . after a year , she was won around to the marriage by henry and beatrice 's promise to remain living with and attending her .
the football team plays at ryan field ( formerly known as dyche stadium ) ; the basketball , wrestling , and volleyball teams play at welsh-ryan arena . northwestern 's athletic teams are nicknamed the wildcats . before 1924 , they were known as " the purple " and unofficially as " the fighting methodists . " the name wildcats was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by wallace abbey , a writer for the chicago daily tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the university of chicago , " football players had not come down from evanston ; wildcats would be a name better suited to [ coach glenn ] thistletwaite 's boys . " the name was so popular that university board members made " wildcats " the official nickname just months later . in 1972 , the student body voted to change the official nickname from " wildcats " to " purple haze " but the new name never stuck .
the majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family , although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack . a dominance model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers , such as on the television program dog whisperer . however it has been disputed that " trying to achieve status " is characteristic of dog–human interactions . pet dogs play an active role in family life ; for example , a study of conversations in dog–human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource , talking to the dog , or talking through the dog , to mediate their interactions with each other .
the emperor julian made a short-lived attempt to revive traditional and hellenistic religion and to affirm the special status of judaism , but in 380 under theodosius i , nicene christianity became the official state religion of the roman empire . pleas for religious tolerance from traditionalists such as the senator symmachus ( d. 402 ) were rejected . christianity became increasingly popular . heretics as well as non-christians were subject to exclusion from public life or persecution , but rome 's original religious hierarchy and many aspects of its ritual influenced christian forms , and many pre-christian beliefs and practices survived in christian festivals and local traditions .
during the earlier medieval period , the vocal music from the liturgical genre , predominantly gregorian chant , was monophonic , using a single , unaccompanied vocal melody line . polyphonic vocal genres , which used multiple independent vocal melodies , began to develop during the high medieval era , becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century .
in theravada buddhism there can be no divine salvation or forgiveness for one 's karma , since it is a purely impersonal process that is a part of the makeup of the universe . [ citation needed ] in mahayana buddhism , the texts of certain mahayana sutras ( such as the lotus sutra , the aṅgulimālīya sūtra and the mahāyāna mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra ) claim that the recitation or merely the hearing of their texts can expunge great swathes of negative karma . some forms of buddhism ( for example , vajrayana ) regard the recitation of mantras as a means for cutting off of previous negative karma . the japanese pure land teacher genshin taught that amitābha has the power to destroy the karma that would otherwise bind one in saṃsāra .
in 1982 , the band released the album hot space , a departure from their trademark seventies sound , this time being a mixture of rock , pop rock , dance , funk , and r & b . most of the album was recorded in munich during the most turbulent period in the band 's history , and taylor and may lamented the new sound , with both being very critical of the influence mercury 's personal manager paul prenter had on the singer . may was also scathing of prenter , who was mercury 's manager from the early 1980s to 1984 , for being dismissive of the importance of radio stations , such as the us networks , and their vital connection between the artist and the community , and for denying them access to mercury . the band stopped touring north america after their hot space tour , as their success there had waned , although they would perform on american television for the only time during the eighth season premiere of saturday night live . queen left elektra records , their label in the united states , canada , japan , australia , and new zealand , and signed onto emi/capitol records .
through victoria 's reign , the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in britain continued . reforms of the voting system increased the power of the house of commons at the expense of the house of lords and the monarch . in 1867 , walter bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained " the right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn " . as victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political , it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values , in contrast to the sexual , financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the house of hanover and which had discredited the monarchy . the concept of the " family monarchy " , with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify , was solidified .
wu chinese has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates : /p pʰ b/ . in addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants , there is a series of muddy consonants , like /b/ . these are pronounced with slack or breathy voice : that is , they are weakly voiced . muddy consonants as initial cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or light ( 陽 yáng ) tone .
himachal pradesh is famous for its abundant natural beauty . after the war between nepal and britain , also known as the anglo-gorkha war ( 1814–1816 ) , the british colonial government came into power and the land now comprising himachal pradesh became part of the punjab province of british india . in 1950 , himachal was declared a union territory , but after the state of himachal pradesh act 1971 , himachal emerged as the 18th state of the republic of india . hima means snow in sanskrit , and the literal meaning of the state 's name is " in the lap of himalayas " . it was named by acharya diwakar datt sharma , one of the great sanskrit scholars of himachal pradesh .
in 1430 with the privileges of jedlnia , confirmed at kraków in 1433 ( polish : " przywileje jedlneńsko-krakowskie " ) , based partially on his earlier brześć kujawski privilege ( april 25 , 1425 ) , king władysław ii jagiełło granted the nobility a guarantee against arbitrary arrest , similar to the english magna carta 's habeas corpus , known from its own latin name as " neminem captivabimus ( nisi jure victum ) . " henceforth no member of the nobility could be imprisoned without a warrant from a court of justice : the king could neither punish nor imprison any noble at his whim . king władysław 's quid pro quo for this boon was the nobles ' guarantee that his throne would be inherited by one of his sons ( who would be bound to honour the privileges theretofore granted to the nobility ) . on may 2 , 1447 the same king issued the wilno privilege which gave the lithuanian boyars the same rights as those possessed by the polish szlachta .
on january 25 , 1918 the third meeting of the all-russian congress of soviets renamed the unrecognized state the soviet russian republic . the treaty of brest-litovsk was signed on march 3 , 1918 , giving away much of the land of the former russian empire to germany in exchange for peace during the rest of world war i . on july 10 , 1918 , the russian constitution of 1918 renamed the country the russian socialist federative soviet republic . by 1918 , during the russian civil war , several states within the former russian empire seceded , reducing the size of the country even more .
but house was also being developed on ibiza , [ citation needed ] although no house artists or labels were coming from this tiny island at the time . by the mid-1980s a distinct balearic mix of house was discernible . [ citation needed ] several clubs such as amnesia with dj alfredo were playing a mix of rock , pop , disco and house . these clubs , fueled by their distinctive sound and ecstasy , began to have an influence on the british scene . by late 1987 , djs such as trevor fung , paul oakenfold and danny rampling were bringing the ibiza sound to uk clubs such as the haçienda in manchester , and in london clubs such as shoom in southwark , heaven , future and spectrum .
the psychoacoustic masking codec was first proposed in 1979 , apparently independently , by manfred r. schroeder , et al . from bell telephone laboratories , inc. in murray hill , nj , and m. a. krasner both in the united states . krasner was the first to publish and to produce hardware for speech ( not usable as music bit compression ) , but the publication of his results as a relatively obscure lincoln laboratory technical report did not immediately influence the mainstream of psychoacoustic codec development . manfred schroeder was already a well-known and revered figure in the worldwide community of acoustical and electrical engineers , but his paper was not much noticed , since it described negative results due to the particular nature of speech and the linear predictive coding ( lpc ) gain present in speech . both krasner and schroeder built upon the work performed by eberhard f. zwicker in the areas of tuning and masking of critical bands , that in turn built on the fundamental research in the area from bell labs of harvey fletcher and his collaborators . a wide variety of ( mostly perceptual ) audio compression algorithms were reported in ieee 's refereed journal on selected areas in communications . that journal reported in february 1988 on a wide range of established , working audio bit compression technologies , some of them using auditory masking as part of their fundamental design , and several showing real-time hardware implementations .
the term carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large catholic presence . however , the philippines , a predominantly roman catholic country , does not celebrate carnival anymore since the dissolution of the manila carnival after 1939 , the last carnival in the country . in historically lutheran countries , the celebration is known as fastelavn , and in areas with a high concentration of anglicans and methodists , pre-lenten celebrations , along with penitential observances , occur on shrove tuesday . in eastern orthodox nations , maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before great lent . in german-speaking europe and the netherlands , the carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 ( often at 11:11 a.m. ) . this dates back to celebrations before the advent season or with harvest celebrations of st. martin 's day .
in 1938 the nazis altered about one-third of the toponyms of the area , eliminating , germanizing , or simplifying a number of old prussian names , as well as those polish or lithuanian names originating from colonists and refugees to prussia during and after the protestant reformation . more than 1,500 places were ordered to be renamed by 16 july 1938 following a decree issued by gauleiter and oberpräsident erich koch and initiated by adolf hitler . many who would not cooperate with the rulers of nazi germany were sent to concentration camps and held prisoner there until their death or liberation .
internationally , victoria took a keen interest in the improvement of relations between france and britain . she made and hosted several visits between the british royal family and the house of orleans , who were related by marriage through the coburgs . in 1843 and 1845 , she and albert stayed with king louis philippe i at château d'eu in normandy ; she was the first british or english monarch to visit a french one since the meeting of henry viii of england and francis i of france on the field of the cloth of gold in 1520 . when louis philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844 , he became the first french king to visit a british sovereign . louis philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 , and fled to exile in england . at the height of a revolutionary scare in the united kingdom in april 1848 , victoria and her family left london for the greater safety of osborne house , a private estate on the isle of wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped . demonstrations by chartists and irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support , and the scare died down without any major disturbances . victoria 's first visit to ireland in 1849 was a public relations success , but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of irish nationalism .
the stated clauses of the nazi-soviet non-aggression pact were a guarantee of non-belligerence by each party towards the other , and a written commitment that neither party would ally itself to , or aid , an enemy of the other party . in addition to stipulations of non-aggression , the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of romania , poland , lithuania , latvia , estonia , and finland into german and soviet " spheres of influence " , anticipating potential " territorial and political rearrangements " of these countries . thereafter , germany invaded poland on 1 september 1939 . after the soviet–japanese ceasefire agreement took effect on 16 september , stalin ordered his own invasion of poland on 17 september . part of southeastern ( karelia ) and salla region in finland were annexed by the soviet union after the winter war . this was followed by soviet annexations of estonia , latvia , lithuania , and parts of romania ( bessarabia , northern bukovina , and the hertza region ) . concern about ethnic ukrainians and belarusians had been proffered as justification for the soviet invasion of poland . stalin 's invasion of bukovina in 1940 violated the pact , as it went beyond the soviet sphere of influence agreed with the axis .
the native american name controversy is an ongoing dispute over the acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas and to broad subsets thereof , such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes . when discussing broader subsets of peoples , naming may be based on shared language , region , or historical relationship . many english exonyms have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the americas . some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists , while others resulted from the colonists ' attempt to translate endonyms from the native language into their own , and yet others were pejorative terms arising out of prejudice and fear , during periods of conflict .
the kakatiya dynasty was reduced to a vassal of the khilji dynasty in 1310 after its defeat by sultan alauddin khilji of the delhi sultanate . this lasted until 1321 , when the kakatiya dynasty was annexed by malik kafur , allaudin khilji 's general . during this period , alauddin khilji took the koh-i-noor diamond , which is said to have been mined from the kollur mines of golkonda , to delhi . muhammad bin tughluq succeeded to the delhi sultanate in 1325 , bringing warangal under the rule of the tughlaq dynasty until 1347 when ala-ud-din bahman shah , a governor under bin tughluq , rebelled against delhi and established the bahmani sultanate in the deccan plateau , with gulbarga , 200 km ( 124 mi ) west of hyderabad , as its capital . the bahmani kings ruled the region until 1518 and were the first independent muslim rulers of the deccan .
while consulting for the moore school of electrical engineering at the university of pennsylvania on the edvac project , von neumann wrote an incomplete first draft of a report on the edvac . the paper , whose premature distribution nullified the patent claims of edvac designers j. presper eckert and john mauchly , described a computer architecture in which the data and the program are both stored in the computer 's memory in the same address space . this architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design , unlike the earliest computers that were " programmed " using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard . although the single-memory , stored program architecture is commonly called von neumann architecture as a result of von neumann 's paper , the architecture 's description was based on the work of j. presper eckert and john william mauchly , inventors of the eniac computer at the university of pennsylvania .
the early islamic literature indicates that the conquest of india was one of the very early ambitions of the muslims , though it was recognized as a particularly difficult one . after conquering persia , the arab umayyad caliphate incorporated parts of what are now afghanistan and pakistan around 720 . the book chach nama chronicles the chacha dynasty 's period , following the demise of the rai dynasty and the ascent of chach of alor to the throne , down to the arab conquest by muhammad bin qasim in the early 8th century ad , by defeating the last hindu monarch of sindh , raja dahir .
each cardinal takes on a titular church , either a church in the city of rome or one of the suburbicarian sees . the only exception is for patriarchs of eastern catholic churches . nevertheless , cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods , discipline , or the service of their titular churches . they are allowed to celebrate mass and hear confessions and lead visits and pilgrimages to their titular churches , in coordination with the staff of the church . they often support their churches monetarily , and many cardinals do keep in contact with the pastoral staffs of their titular churches .
queen 's popularity was stimulated in north america when " bohemian rhapsody " was featured in the 1992 comedy film wayne 's world . its inclusion helped the song reach number two on the billboard hot 100 for five weeks in 1992 ( it remained in the hot 100 for over 40 weeks ) , and won the band an mtv award at the 1992 mtv video music awards . the compilation album classic queen also reached number four on the billboard 200 , and is certified three times platinum in the us . wayne 's world footage was used to make a new music video for " bohemian rhapsody " , with which the band and management were delighted .
green and the cpi further noted another exploit of the esa in their discussion of the critically endangered cotton-top tamarin ( saguinus oedipus ) . not only had they found documentation that 151 of these primates had inadvertently made their way from the harvard-affiliated new england regional primate research center into the exotic pet trade through the aforementioned loophole , but in october 1976 , over 800 cotton-top tamarins were imported into the united states in order to beat the official listing of the species under the esa .
holes through a pcb are typically drilled with small-diameter drill bits made of solid coated tungsten carbide . coated tungsten carbide is recommended since many board materials are very abrasive and drilling must be high rpm and high feed to be cost effective . drill bits must also remain sharp so as not to mar or tear the traces . drilling with high-speed-steel is simply not feasible since the drill bits will dull quickly and thus tear the copper and ruin the boards . the drilling is performed by automated drilling machines with placement controlled by a drill tape or drill file . these computer-generated files are also called numerically controlled drill ( ncd ) files or " excellon files " . the drill file describes the location and size of each drilled hole .
american political scientist mark cooper asserted that nasser 's charisma and his direct relationship with the egyptian people " rendered intermediaries ( organizations and individuals ) unnecessary " . he opined that nasser 's legacy was a " guarantee of instability " due to nasser 's reliance on personal power and the absence of strong political institutions under his rule . historian abd al-azim ramadan wrote that nasser was an irrational and irresponsible leader , blaming his inclination to solitary decision-making for egypt 's losses during the suez war , among other events . miles copeland , jr. , once described as nasser 's closest western adviser , said that the barriers between nasser and the outside world have grown so thick that all but the information that attest to his infallibility , indispensability , and immortality has been filtered out .
another study of dogs ' roles in families showed many dogs have set tasks or routines undertaken as family members , the most common of which was helping with the washing-up by licking the plates in the dishwasher , and bringing in the newspaper from the lawn . increasingly , human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog , or in which the dog is an integral partner , such as dog dancing and dog yoga .
in march 2003 , a second rebel group , movement for democracy in liberia , began launching attacks against taylor from the southeast . peace talks between the factions began in accra in june of that year , and taylor was indicted by the special court for sierra leone for crimes against humanity that same month . by july 2003 , the rebels had launched an assault on monrovia . under heavy pressure from the international community and the domestic women of liberia mass action for peace movement , taylor resigned in august 2003 and went into exile in nigeria .
court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of edward vii . these young women were known as débutantes , and the occasion—termed their " coming out " —represented their first entrée into society . débutantes wore full court dress , with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair . they entered , curtsied , and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy , while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length . ( the ceremony , known as an evening court , corresponded to the " court drawing rooms " of victoria 's reign . ) after world war ii , the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions , usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress .
during the american civil war , american cotton exports slumped due to a union blockade on southern ports , and also because of a strategic decision by the confederate government to cut exports , hoping to force britain to recognize the confederacy or enter the war . this prompted the main purchasers of cotton , britain and france , to turn to egyptian cotton . british and french traders invested heavily in cotton plantations . the egyptian government of viceroy isma'il took out substantial loans from european bankers and stock exchanges . after the american civil war ended in 1865 , british and french traders abandoned egyptian cotton and returned to cheap american exports , [ citation needed ] sending egypt into a deficit spiral that led to the country declaring bankruptcy in 1876 , a key factor behind egypt 's occupation by the british empire in 1882 .
since 1898 , puerto rico has had limited representation in the congress in the form of a resident commissioner , a nonvoting delegate . the 110th congress returned the commissioner 's power to vote in the committee of the whole , but not on matters where the vote would represent a decisive participation . puerto rico has elections on the united states presidential primary or caucus of the democratic party and the republican party to select delegates to the respective parties ' national conventions although presidential electors are not granted on the electoral college . as american citizens , puerto ricans can vote in u.s. presidential elections , provided they reside in one of the 50 states or the district of columbia and not in puerto rico itself .
technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons . first , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified . second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease . this amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using pcr . third , the essential tools for directing pcr , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
^9 sub-groups of croats include bunjevci ( in bačka ) , šokci ( in slavonia and vojvodina ) , janjevci ( in kosovo ) , burgenland croats ( in austria ) , bosniaks ( in hungary ) , molise croats ( in italy ) , krashovans ( in romania ) , moravian croats ( in the czech republic )
in 1839 , melbourne resigned after radicals and tories ( both of whom victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of jamaica . the bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . the queen commissioned a tory , sir robert peel , to form a new ministry . at the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the royal household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . many of the queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of whigs , and peel expected to replace them with wives of tories . in what became known as the bedchamber crisis , victoria , advised by melbourne , objected to their removal . peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing melbourne to return to office .
the most precise timekeeping device of the ancient world was the water clock , or clepsydra , one of which was found in the tomb of egyptian pharaoh amenhotep i ( 1525–1504 bc ) . they could be used to measure the hours even at night , but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water . the ancient greeks and the people from chaldea ( southeastern mesopotamia ) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations . arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the middle ages . in the 11th century , chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism .
in 1955 , dc sinclair and g weddell developed peripheral pattern theory , based on a 1934 suggestion by john paul nafe . they proposed that all skin fiber endings ( with the exception of those innervating hair cells ) are identical , and that pain is produced by intense stimulation of these fibers . another 20th-century theory was gate control theory , introduced by ronald melzack and patrick wall in the 1965 science article " pain mechanisms : a new theory " . the authors proposed that both thin ( pain ) and large diameter ( touch , pressure , vibration ) nerve fibers carry information from the site of injury to two destinations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord , and that the more large fiber activity relative to thin fiber activity at the inhibitory cell , the less pain is felt . both peripheral pattern theory and gate control theory have been superseded by more modern theories of pain [ citation needed ] .
drug discovery and development is very expensive ; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually approved in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards , who have to approve new drugs before they can be marketed in those countries . in 2010 18 nmes ( new molecular entities ) were approved and three biologics by the fda , or 21 in total , which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008 . on the other hand , there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006 . since 2001 , the center for drug evaluation and research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year . this approval comes only after heavy investment in pre-clinical development and clinical trials , as well as a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring . drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs , while generating no revenue in return . if the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account , the cost of developing a successful new drug ( new chemical entity , or nce ) , has been estimated at about 1.3 billion usd ( not including marketing expenses ) . professors light and lexchin reported in 2012 , however , that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades .
the richmond area has many major institutions of higher education , including virginia commonwealth university ( public ) , university of richmond ( private ) , virginia union university ( private ) , virginia college ( private ) , south university - richmond ( private , for-profit ) , union theological seminary & presbyterian school of christian education ( private ) , and the baptist theological seminary in richmond ( btsr—private ) . several community colleges are found in the metro area , including j. sargeant reynolds community college and john tyler community college ( chesterfield county ) . in addition , there are several technical colleges in richmond including itt technical institute , ecpi college of technology and centura college . there are several vocational colleges also , such as fortis college and bryant stratton college .
in 1936 , when tito stayed at the hotel lux in moscow , he met the austrian comrade lucia bauer . they married in october 1936 , but the records of this marriage were later erased .
the rsfsr was established on november 7 , 1917 ( october revolution ) as a sovereign state . the first constitution was adopted in 1918 . in 1922 the russian sfsr signed the treaty on the creation of the ussr .
coptic christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from disproportionate representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . intolerance of bahá'ís and non-orthodox muslim sects , such as sufis , shi'a and ahmadis , also remains a problem . when the government moved to computerise identification cards , members of religious minorities , such as bahá'ís , could not obtain identification documents . an egyptian court ruled in early 2008 that members of other faiths may obtain identity cards without listing their faiths , and without becoming officially recognised .
in the 2011–12 season , arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary . the celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season . the crest was all white , surrounded by 15 oak leaves to the right and 15 laurel leaves to the left . the oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the royal oak pub . the 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club . the laurel leaves also represent strength . to complete the crest , 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto " forward " at the bottom of the crest .
in the final days of world war ii in yugoslavia , units of the partisans were responsible for atrocities after the repatriations of bleiburg , and accusations of culpability were later raised at the yugoslav leadership under tito . at the time , josip broz tito repeatedly issued calls for surrender to the retreating column , offering amnesty and attempting to avoid a disorderly surrender . on 14 may he dispatched a telegram to the supreme headquarters slovene partisan army prohibiting " in the sternest language " the execution of prisoners of war and commanding the transfer of the possible suspects to a military court .
the new kingdom c. 1550–1070 bc began with the eighteenth dynasty , marking the rise of egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as tombos in nubia , and included parts of the levant in the east . this period is noted for some of the most well known pharaohs , including hatshepsut , thutmose iii , akhenaten and his wife nefertiti , tutankhamun and ramesses ii . the first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as atenism . frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the new kingdom . the country was later invaded and conquered by libyans , nubians and assyrians , but native egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country .
helmut hoffman states that the ming upheld the facade of rule over tibet through periodic missions of " tribute emissaries " to the ming court and by granting nominal titles to ruling lamas , but did not actually interfere in tibetan governance . melvyn c. goldstein writes that the ming had no real administrative authority over tibet , as the various titles given to tibetan leaders did not confer authority as the earlier mongol yuan titles had . he asserts that " by conferring titles on tibetans already in power , the ming emperors merely recognized political reality . " hugh edward richardson writes that the ming dynasty exercised no authority over the succession of tibetan ruling families , the phagmodru ( 1354–1435 ) , rinpungpa ( 1435–1565 ) , and tsangpa ( 1565–1642 ) .
a number of writing systems have been used over the years for transcribing the language . of these , the somali alphabet is the most widely used , and has been the official writing script in somalia since the government of former president of somalia mohamed siad barre formally introduced it in october 1972 . the script was developed by the somali linguist shire jama ahmed specifically for the somali language , and uses all letters of the english latin alphabet except p , v and z . besides ahmed 's latin script , other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing somali include the long-established arabic script and wadaad 's writing . indigenous writing systems developed in the twentieth century include the osmanya , borama and kaddare scripts , which were invented by osman yusuf kenadid , abdurahman sheikh nuur and hussein sheikh ahmed kaddare , respectively .
in southeast asian colonies , such as hong kong , child labour such as the mui tsai ( 妹仔 ) , was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by british authorities . the dutch east india company officials rationalised their child labour abuses with , " it is a way to save these children from a worse fate . " christian mission schools in regions stretching from zambia to nigeria too required work from children , and in exchange provided religious education , not secular education . elsewhere , the canadian dominion statutes in form of so-called breaches of contract act , stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers .
the settlements at tilsit gave napoleon time to organize his empire . one of his major objectives became enforcing the continental system against the british . he decided to focus his attention on the kingdom of portugal , which consistently violated his trade prohibitions . after defeat in the war of the oranges in 1801 , portugal adopted a double-sided policy . at first , john vi agreed to close his ports to british trade . the situation changed dramatically after the franco-spanish defeat at trafalgar ; john grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with britain .
the simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection , but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed . brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with , but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives , and then sliced apart for examination of the interior . visually , the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter , with a dark color , separated by areas of white matter , with a lighter color . further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations . it is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope , and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another .
in 1948 , eisenhower became president of columbia university , an ivy league university in new york city . the assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction . during that year eisenhower 's memoir , crusade in europe , was published . critics regarded it as one of the finest u.s. military memoirs , and it was a major financial success as well . eisenhower 's profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the u.s. department of the treasury that eisenhower was not a professional writer , but rather , marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences , and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his $ 635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate . this ruling saved eisenhower about $ 400,000 .
parisian examples of european architecture date back more than a millennium ; including the romanesque church of the abbey of saint-germain-des-prés ( 1014-1163 ) ; the early gothic architecture of the basilica of saint-denis ( 1144 ) , the notre dame cathedral ( 1163-1345 ) , the flamboyant gothic of saint chapelle ( 1239-1248 ) , the baroque churches of saint-paul-saint-louis ( 1627-1641 ) and les invalides ( 1670-1708 ) . the 19th century produced the neoclassical church of la madeleine ( 1808-1842 ) ; the palais garnier opera house ( 1875 ) ; the neo-byzantine basilica of sacré-cœur ( 1875-1919 ) , and the exuberant belle époque modernism of the eiffel tower ( 1889 ) . striking examples of 20th century architecture include the centre georges pompidou by richard rogers and renzo piano ( 1977 ) , and the louvre pyramid by i.m . pei ( 1989 ) . contemporary architecture includes the musée du quai branly by jean nouvel ( 2006 ) and the new contemporary art museum of the louis vuitton foundation by frank gehry ( 2014 ) .
the convention in the english language is to call nearly all national heads of government " prime minister " ( sometimes modified to the equivalent term of premier ) , regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country . the few exceptions to the rule are germany and austria , whose heads of government titles are almost always translated as chancellor ; monaco , whose head of government is referred to as the minister of state ; and vatican city , for which the head of government is titled the secretary of state . in the case of ireland , the head of government is occasionally referred to as the taoiseach by english speakers . a stand-out case is the president of iran , who is not actually a head of state , but the head of the government of iran . he is referred to as " president " in both the persian and english languages .
by the verse quran , 2:124 , shias believe that imamah is a divine position always imamah is accompanied by the word guidance , of course a guidance by god 's command.a kind of guidance which brings humanity to the goal . regarding 17:71 , no age can be without an imam . so , according to the upper verse 1.imamah is a position which is appointed by god and must be specified by him 2.imam is protected by a divine protection and no one exceles him in nobility 3 . no age can be without an imam and finally imam knows everything which is needed for human being to get to the truth and goal .
norfolk island was colonised by east polynesians but was long unpeopled when it was settled by great britain as part of its settlement of australia from 1788 . the island served as a convict penal settlement from 6 march 1788 until 5 may 1855 , except for an 11-year hiatus between 15 february 1814 and 6 june 1825 , when it lay abandoned . on 8 june 1856 , permanent civilian residence on the island began when it was settled from pitcairn island . in 1913 , the uk handed norfolk over to australia to administer as an external territory .
the managing director of london weekend television ( lwt ) , greg dyke , met with the representatives of the " big five " football clubs in england in 1990 . the meeting was to pave the way for a break away from the football league . dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for lwt if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money . the five clubs decided it was a good idea and decided to press ahead with it ; however , the league would have no credibility without the backing of the football association and so david dein of arsenal held talks to see whether the fa were receptive to the idea . the fa did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the football league at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the football league 's position .
over two centuries after the removal of the capital to beijing , nanjing was destined to become the capital of a ming emperor one more time . after the fall of beijing to li zicheng 's rebel forces and then to the manchu-led qing dynasty in the spring of 1644 , the ming prince zhu yousong was enthroned in nanjing in june 1644 as the hongguang emperor . his short reign was described by later historians as the first reign of the so-called southern ming dynasty .
new haven lies in the transition between a humid continental climate ( köppen climate classification : dfa ) and humid subtropical climate ( köppen cfa ) , but having more characteristics of the former , as is typical of much of the new york metropolitan area . summers are humid and warm , with temperatures exceeding 90 °f ( 32 °c ) on 7–8 days per year . winters are cold with moderate snowfall interspersed with rainfall and occasionally mixed precipitation . the weather patterns that affect new haven result from a primarily offshore direction , thus reducing the marine influence of long island sound—although , like other marine areas , differences in temperature between areas right along the coastline and areas a mile or two inland can be large at times .
the noise-based speed is defined as the exposure that will lead to a given signal-to-noise ratio on individual pixels . two ratios are used , the 40:1 ( " excellent image quality " ) and the 10:1 ( " acceptable image quality " ) ratio . these ratios have been subjectively determined based on a resolution of 70 pixels per cm ( 178 dpi ) when viewed at 25 cm ( 9.8 inch ) distance . the signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the standard deviation of a weighted average of the luminance and color of individual pixels . the noise-based speed is mostly determined by the properties of the sensor and somewhat affected by the noise in the electronic gain and ad converter .
based on the strength of his work , universal signed spielberg to do four tv films . the first was a richard matheson adaptation called duel . the film is about a psychotic peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver ( dennis weaver ) of a small plymouth valiant and tries to run him off the road . special praise of this film by the influential british critic dilys powell was highly significant to spielberg 's career . another tv film ( something evil ) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of the exorcist , then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film . he fulfilled his contract by directing the tv film-length pilot of a show called savage , starring martin landau . spielberg 's debut full-length feature film was the sugarland express , about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby . spielberg 's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers , and the hollywood reporter stated that " a major new director is on the horizon . " :223 however , the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release .
this change is interesting from a sociolinguistic point of view because it has apparently happened relatively recently , in the 1970s , and was pioneered by older well-educated women from the upper middle classes . the lowering of the diphthongs has long been current in many dutch dialects , and is comparable to the english great vowel shift , and the diphthongisation of long high vowels in modern high german , which centuries earlier reached the state now found in polder dutch . stroop theorizes that the lowering of open-mid to open diphthongs is a phonetically " natural " and inevitable development and that dutch , after having diphthongised the long high vowels like german and english , " should " have lowered the diphthongs like german and english as well .
the major roles of construction and of services ( government , communications , banking and finance , food production , entertainment , and legal services ) in brasília 's economy reflect the city 's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center . industries connected with construction , food processing , and furnishings are important , as are those associated with publishing , printing , and computer software . gdp is divided in public administration 54.8 % , services 28.7 % , industry 10.2 % , commerce 6.1 % , agribusiness 0.2 % .
23-year-old candice glover won the season with kree harrison taking the runner-up spot . glover is the first female to win american idol since jordin sparks . glover released " i am beautiful " as a single while harrison released " all cried out " immediately after the show . glover sold poorly with her debut album , and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label .
one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed ( but not understood at the time ) was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen , half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived . maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures . according to quantum theory , this behavior arises from the spacing of the ( quantized ) rotational energy levels , which are particularly wide-spaced in h2 because of its low mass . these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures . diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect .
unusually among the olympic deities , apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence : delos and delphi . in cult practice , delian apollo and pythian apollo ( the apollo of delphi ) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . apollo 's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity . oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century ce , those at didyma and clarus pronounced the so-called " theological oracles " , in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing , highest deity . " in the 3rd century , apollo fell silent . julian the apostate ( 359 - 61 ) tried to revive the delphic oracle , but failed . "
in 1 april 2012 by-elections the nld won 43 of the 45 available seats ; previously an illegal organisation , the nld had never won a burmese election until this time . the 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were allowed to monitor the voting process in myanmar . following announcement of the by-elections , the freedom house organisation raised concerns about " reports of fraud and harassment in the lead up to elections , including the march 23 deportation of somsri hananuntasuk , executive director of the asian network for free elections ( anfrel ) , a regional network of civil society organisations promoting democratization . " however , uncertainties exist as some other political prisoners have not been released and clashes between burmese troops and local insurgent groups continue .
in the 21st century , these trends have continued , and several new approaches have come into prominence , including multielectrode recording , which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time ; genetic engineering , which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally ; genomics , which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in dna properties and neuroimaging .
by the late 1950s , the motion picture business was again changing . the combination of the studio/theater-chain break-up and the rise of television saw the reduced audience size for cinema productions . the music corporation of america ( mca ) , then predominately a talent agency , had also become a powerful television producer , renting space at republic studios for its revue productions subsidiary . after a period of complete shutdown , a moribund universal agreed to sell its 360-acre ( 1.5 km² ) studio lot to mca in 1958 , for $ 11 million , renamed revue studios . mca owned the studio lot , but not universal pictures , yet was increasingly influential on universal 's product . the studio lot was upgraded and modernized , while mca clients like doris day , lana turner , cary grant , and director alfred hitchcock were signed to universal pictures contracts .
the relational model also allowed the content of the database to evolve without constant rewriting of links and pointers . the relational part comes from entities referencing other entities in what is known as one-to-many relationship , like a traditional hierarchical model , and many-to-many relationship , like a navigational ( network ) model . thus , a relational model can express both hierarchical and navigational models , as well as its native tabular model , allowing for pure or combined modeling in terms of these three models , as the application requires .
the sumerian city-states rose to power during the prehistoric ubaid and uruk periods . sumerian written history reaches back to the 27th century bc and before , but the historical record remains obscure until the early dynastic iii period , c. the 23rd century bc , when a now deciphered syllabary writing system was developed , which has allowed archaeologists to read contemporary records and inscriptions . classical sumer ends with the rise of the akkadian empire in the 23rd century bc . following the gutian period , there is a brief sumerian renaissance in the 21st century bc , cut short in the 20th century bc by semitic amorite invasions . the amorite " dynasty of isin " persisted until c. 1700 bc , when mesopotamia was united under babylonian rule . the sumerians were eventually absorbed into the akkadian ( assyro-babylonian ) population .
the interceptor aircraft ( or simply interceptor ) is a type of fighter aircraft designed specifically to intercept and destroy enemy aircraft , particularly bombers , usually relying on high speed and altitude capabilities . a number of jet interceptors such as the f-102 delta dagger , the f-106 delta dart , and the mig-25 were built in the period starting after the end of world war ii and ending in the late 1960s , when they became less important due to the shifting of the strategic bombing role to icbms . invariably the type is differentiated from other fighter aircraft designs by higher speeds and shorter operating ranges , as well as much reduced ordnance payloads .
in the final decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer . the long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to fight , while their farms fell into disrepair . the landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices . as commodity prices fell , many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit . the result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers . masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into rome , and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies . their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most . a new culture of dependency was emerging , in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief .
the kingdoms of england and scotland were unified in 1707 creating the kingdom of great britain . following an attempted republican revolution in ireland in 1798 , the kingdoms of ireland and great britain were unified in 1801 , creating the united kingdom . the isle of man and the channel islands remaining outside of the united kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the british crown ( effectively the british government ) . although , the colonies of north american that would become the united states of america were lost by the start of the 19th century , the british empire expanded rapidly elsewhere . a century later it would cover one third of the globe . poverty in the united kingdom remained desperate however and industrialisation in england led to terrible condition for the working class . mass migrations following the irish famine and highland clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands ' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of ireland in the second-half of the 19th century . most of ireland seceded from the united kingdom after the irish war of independence and the subsequent anglo-irish treaty ( 1919–1922 ) , with the six counties that formed northern ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the uk .
japanese seismologist yuji yagi at the university of tsukuba said that the earthquake occurred in two stages : " the 155-mile longmenshan fault tore in two sections , the first one ripping about seven yards , followed by a second one that sheared four yards . " his data also showed that the earthquake lasted about two minutes and released 30 times the energy of the great hanshin earthquake of 1995 in japan , which killed over 6,000 people . he pointed out that the shallowness of the epicenter and the density of population greatly increased the severity of the earthquake . teruyuki kato , a seismologist at the university of tokyo , said that the seismic waves of the quake traveled a long distance without losing their power because of the firmness of the terrain in central china . according to reports from chengdu , the capital of sichuan province , the earthquake tremors lasted for " about two or three minutes " .
beyoncé giselle knowles was born in houston , texas , to celestine ann " tina " knowles ( née beyincé ) , a hairdresser and salon owner , and mathew knowles , a xerox sales manager . beyoncé 's name is a tribute to her mother 's maiden name . beyoncé 's younger sister solange is also a singer and a former member of destiny 's child . mathew is african-american , while tina is of louisiana creole descent ( with african , native american , french , cajun , and distant irish and spanish ancestry ) . through her mother , beyoncé is a descendant of acadian leader joseph broussard . she was raised in a methodist household .
in iran ( persia ) , the history of cotton dates back to the achaemenid era ( 5th century bc ) ; however , there are few sources about the planting of cotton in pre-islamic iran . the planting of cotton was common in merv , ray and pars of iran . in persian poets ' poems , especially ferdowsi 's shahname , there are references to cotton ( " panbe " in persian ) . marco polo ( 13th century ) refers to the major products of persia , including cotton . john chardin , a french traveler of the 17th century who visited the safavid persia , spoke approvingly of the vast cotton farms of persia .
for instance , a common use of a database system is to track information about users , their name , login information , various addresses and phone numbers . in the navigational approach all of this data would be placed in a single record , and unused items would simply not be placed in the database . in the relational approach , the data would be normalized into a user table , an address table and a phone number table ( for instance ) . records would be created in these optional tables only if the address or phone numbers were actually provided .
the events of the summer of 1974 dominate the politics on the island , as well as greco-turkish relations . around 150,000 settlers from turkey are believed to be living in the north—many of whom were forced from turkey by the turkish government—in violation of the geneva convention and various un resolutions . following the invasion and the capture of its northern territory by turkish troops , the republic of cyprus announced that all of its ports of entry in the north were closed , as they were effectively not under its control .

beer ranges from less than 3 % alcohol by volume ( abv ) to around 14 % abv , though this strength can be increased to around 20 % by re-pitching with champagne yeast , and to 55 % abv by the freeze-distilling process . the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style . the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4–6 % , with a typical abv of 5 % . the customary strength of british ales is quite low , with many session beers being around 4 % abv . some beers , such as table beer are of such low alcohol content ( 1 % –4 % ) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools .
one of the han 's greatest mathematical advancements was the world 's first use of negative numbers . negative numbers first appeared in the nine chapters on the mathematical art as black counting rods , where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods . negative numbers are used in the bakhshali manuscript of ancient india , but its exact date of compilation is unknown . negative numbers were also used by the greek mathematician diophantus in about 275 ad , but were not widely accepted in europe until the 16th century ad .
the dominican order was affected by a number of elemental influences . its early members imbued the order with a mysticism and learning . the europeans of the order embraced ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and looked to a union with the creator . the english dominicans looked for this complete unity as well , but were not so focused on ecstatic experiences . instead , their goal was to emulate the moral life of christ more completely . the dartford nuns were surrounded by all of these legacies , and used them to create something unique . though they are not called mystics , they are known for their piety toward god and their determination to live lives devoted to , and in emulation of , him .
in central portions of the u.s. , tornadoes are more common than anywhere else on earth and touch down most commonly in the spring and summer . deadly and destructive hurricanes occur almost every year along the atlantic seaboard and the gulf of mexico . the appalachian region and the midwest experience the worst floods , though virtually no area in the u.s. is immune to flooding . the southwest has the worst droughts ; one is thought to have lasted over 500 years and to have hurt ancestral pueblo peoples . the west is affected by large wildfires each year .
this is not to say that whitehead 's thought was widely accepted or even well-understood . his philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon . even professional philosophers struggled to follow whitehead 's writings . one famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of whitehead 's philosophy centers around the delivery of whitehead 's gifford lectures in 1927–28 – following arthur eddington 's lectures of the year previous – which whitehead would later publish as process and reality :
portugal is a significant european minerals producer and is ranked among europe 's leading copper producers . the nation is also a notable producer of tin , tungsten and uranium . however , the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium , a limitation that has hindered the development of portugal 's mining and metallurgy sectors . although the country has vast iron and coal reserves—mainly in the north—after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization , low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals . the panasqueira and neves-corvo mines are among the most recognised portuguese mines that are still in operation .

among predators there is a large degree of specialization . many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey . others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything ( examples : humans , leopards , dogs and alligators ) . the specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey . the prey in turn , are often equally suited to escape that predator . this is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium . some predators specialize in certain classes of prey , not just single species . some will switch to other prey ( with varying degrees of success ) when the preferred target is extremely scarce , and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible .

according to walter gratzer , the study of nutrition probably began during the 6th century bc . in china , the concept of qi developed , a spirit or " wind " similar to what western europeans later called pneuma . food was classified into " hot " ( for example , meats , blood , ginger , and hot spices ) and " cold " ( green vegetables ) in china , india , malaya , and persia . humours developed perhaps first in china alongside qi . ho the physician concluded that diseases are caused by deficiencies of elements ( wu xing : fire , water , earth , wood , and metal ) , and he classified diseases as well as prescribed diets . about the same time in italy , alcmaeon of croton ( a greek ) wrote of the importance of equilibrium between what goes in and what goes out , and warned that imbalance would result disease marked by obesity or emaciation .
from the 19th century , there was a revival in many ancient glass-making techniques including cameo glass , achieved for the first time since the roman empire and initially mostly used for pieces in a neo-classical style . the art nouveau movement made great use of glass , with rené lalique , émile gallé , and daum of nancy producing colored vases and similar pieces , often in cameo glass , and also using luster techniques . louis comfort tiffany in america specialized in stained glass , both secular and religious , and his famous lamps . the early 20th-century saw the large-scale factory production of glass art by firms such as waterford and lalique . from about 1960 onwards there have been an increasing number of small studios hand-producing glass artworks , and glass artists began to class themselves as in effect sculptors working in glass , and their works as part fine arts .
the bbc also introduced ceefax , the first teletext service , starting in 1974 . this service allows bbc viewers to view textual information such as the latest news on their television . ceefax has not made a full transition to digital television , instead being replaced by the new interactive bbci service .
during the snes 's life , nintendo contracted with two different companies to develop a cd-rom-based peripheral for the console to compete with sega 's cd-rom based addon , mega-cd . ultimately , deals with both sony and philips fell through , ( although a prototype console was produced by sony ) with philips gaining the right to release a series of titles based on nintendo franchises for its cd-i multimedia player and sony going on to develop its own console based on its initial dealings with nintendo ( the playstation ) .
in 2013 , houston was identified as the # 1 u.s. city for job creation by the u.s. bureau of statistics after it was not only the first major city to regain all the jobs lost in the preceding economic downturn , but after the crash , more than two jobs were added for every one lost . economist and vice president of research at the greater houston partnership patrick jankowski attributed houston 's success to the ability of the region 's real estate and energy industries to learn from historical mistakes . furthermore , jankowski stated that " more than 100 foreign-owned companies relocated , expanded or started new businesses in houston " between 2008 and 2010 , and this openness to external business boosted job creation during a period when domestic demand was problematically low . also in 2013 , houston again appeared on forbes ' list of best places for business and careers .

born in bay city , michigan , madonna moved to new york city in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance . after performing in the music groups breakfast club and emmy , she signed with sire records ( an auxiliary label of warner bros. records ) in 1982 and released her self-titled debut album the following year . she followed it with a series of commercially and critcally successful albums , including the grammy award winners ray of light ( 1998 ) and confessions on a dance floor ( 2005 ) . throughout her career , madonna has written and produced most of her songs , with many of them reaching number one on the record charts , including " like a virgin " , " into the groove " , " papa do n't preach " , " like a prayer " , " vogue " , " frozen " , " music " , " hung up " , and " 4 minutes " .
american idol became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting season four , and by the next season , it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series , selling over $ 700,000 for a 30-seconds slot , and reaching up to $ 1.3 million for the finale . its ad prices reached a peak in season seven at $ 737,000 . estimated revenue more than doubled from $ 404 million in season three to $ 870 million in season six . while that declined from season eight onwards , it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor , with advertising revenue topping $ 800 million annually the next few seasons . however , the sharp drop in ratings in season eleven also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for season twelve , and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers . by 2014 , ad revenue from had fallen to $ 427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $ 300,000 .
the nes uses a custom-made picture processing unit ( ppu ) developed by ricoh . all variations of the ppu feature 2 kb of video ram , 256 bytes of on-die " object attribute memory " ( oam ) to store the positions , colors , and tile indices of up to 64 sprites on the screen , and 28 bytes of on-die palette ram to allow selection of background and sprite colors . the console 's 2 kb of onboard ram may be used for tile maps and attributes on the nes board and 8 kb of tile pattern rom or ram may be included on a cartridge . the system has an available color palette of 48 colors and 6 grays . up to 25 simultaneous colors may be used without writing new values mid-frame : a background color , four sets of three tile colors and four sets of three sprite colors . the nes palette is based on ntsc rather than rgb values . a total of 64 sprites may be displayed onscreen at a given time without reloading sprites mid-screen . the standard display resolution of the nes is 256 horizontal pixels by 240 vertical pixels .
philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one 's sense-based experience . this view is commonly contrasted with rationalism , which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses . for example , john locke held that some knowledge ( e.g . knowledge of god 's existence ) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone . similarly robert boyle , a prominent advocate of the experimental method , held that we have innate ideas . the main continental rationalists ( descartes , spinoza , and leibniz ) were also advocates of the empirical " scientific method " .
the city is also home to the heineken brewery that brews murphy 's irish stout and the nearby beamish and crawford brewery ( taken over by heineken in 2008 ) which have been in the city for generations . 45 % of the world 's tic tac sweets are manufactured at the city 's ferrero factory . for many years , cork was the home to ford motor company , which manufactured cars in the docklands area before the plant was closed in 1984 . henry ford 's grandfather was from west cork , which was one of the main reasons for opening up the manufacturing facility in cork . but technology has replaced the old manufacturing businesses of the 1970s and 1980s , with people now working in the many i.t . centres of the city – such as amazon.com , the online retailer , which has set up in cork airport business park .
through most of shell 's early history , the shell oil company business in the united states was substantially independent with its stock being traded on the nyse and with little direct involvement from the group 's central offices in the running of the american business . however , in 1984 , royal dutch shell made a bid to purchase those shares of shell oil company it did not own ( around 30 % ) and despite opposition from some minority shareholders , which led to a court case , shell completed the buyout for a sum of $ 5.7 billion .
in a course at the lsa summer institute in 1991 , alan prince and paul smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance ; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint . the approach was soon extended to morphology by john mccarthy and alan prince , and has become a dominant trend in phonology . the appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements ( e.g . features ) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology ' , especially mark hale and charles reiss .
mianyang hi-tech industrial development zone was established in 1992 , with a planned area of 43 km2 ( 17 sq mi ) . the zone is situated 96 kilometers away from chengdu , and is 8 km ( 5.0 mi ) away from mianyang airport . since its establishment , the zone accumulated 177.4 billion yuan of industrial output , 46.2 billion yuan of gross domestic product , fiscal revenue 6.768 billion yuan . there are more than 136 high-tech enterprises in the zone and they accounted for more than 90 % of the total industrial output .
in the increasingly globalized film industry , videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production . for example , for the 2013 award-winning animated film frozen , burbank-based walt disney animation studios hired the new york city-based husband-and-wife songwriting team of robert lopez and kristen anderson-lopez to write the songs , which required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months .

in the early 20th century came another turn toward nationalist politics with solidaridad gallega ( 1907–1912 ) modeled on solidaritat catalana in catalonia . solidaridad gallega failed , but in 1916 irmandades da fala ( brotherhood of the language ) developed first as a cultural association but soon as a full-blown nationalist movement . vicente risco and ramón otero pedrayo were outstanding cultural figures of this movement , and the magazine nós ( 'us ' ) , founded 1920 , its most notable cultural institution , lois peña novo the outstanding political figure .
a person 's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain , with health care professionals tending to underestimate severity . a definition of pain widely employed in nursing , emphasizing its subjective nature and the importance of believing patient reports , was introduced by margo mccaffery in 1968 : " pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is , existing whenever he says it does " . to assess intensity , the patient may be asked to locate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 , with 0 being no pain at all , and 10 the worst pain they have ever felt . quality can be established by having the patient complete the mcgill pain questionnaire indicating which words best describe their pain .
roman religion was thus practical and contractual , based on the principle of do ut des , " i give that you might give . " religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer , ritual , and sacrifice , not on faith or dogma , although latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs . even the most skeptical among rome 's intellectual elite such as cicero , who was an augur , saw religion as a source of social order . for ordinary romans , religion was a part of daily life . each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family 's domestic deities were offered . neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city . the roman calendar was structured around religious observances . women , slaves , and children all participated in a range of religious activities . some public rituals could be conducted only by women , and women formed what is perhaps rome 's most famous priesthood , the state-supported vestals , who tended rome 's sacred hearth for centuries , until disbanded under christian domination .
it 's generally accepted that there are around 750 verses in the quran dealing with natural phenomenon . in many of these verses the study of nature is " encouraged and highly recommended , " and historical islamic scientists like al-biruni and al-battani derived their inspiration from verses of the quran . mohammad hashim kamali has the stated that " scientific observation , experimental knowledge and rationality " are the primary tools with which humanity can achieve the goals laid out for it in the quran . ziauddin sardar built a case for muslims having developed the foundations of modern science , by highlighting the repeated calls of the quran to observe and reflect upon natural phenomenon . " the 'scientific method , ' as it is understood today , was first developed by muslim scientists " like ibn al-haytham and al-biruni , along with numerous other muslim scientists .
during the last decade , philadelphia experienced a large shift in its age profile . in 2000 , the city 's population pyramid had a largely stationary shape . in 2013 , the city took on an expansive pyramid shape , with an increase in the three millennial age groups , 20 to 24 , 25 to 29 , and 30 to 34 . the city 's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city 's largest age cohort . according to the 2010 census , 343,837 ( 22.5 % ) were under the age of 18 ; 203,697 ( 13.3 % ) from 18 to 25 ; 434,385 ( 28.5 % ) from 25 to 44 ; 358,778 ( 23.5 % ) from 45 to 64 ; and 185,309 ( 12.1 % ) who were 65 years of age or older . the median age was 33.5 years . for every 100 females there were 89.4 males . for every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 85.7 males . the city had 22,018 births in 2013 , down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008 . philadelphia 's death rate was at its lowest in at least a half-century , 13,691 deaths in 2013 . another factor attributing to the population increase is philadelphia 's immigration rate . in 2013 , 12.7 percent of residents were foreign-born , just shy of the national average , 13.1 percent .
an example of mutual symbiosis is the relationship between the ocellaris clownfish that dwell among the tentacles of ritteri sea anemones . the territorial fish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish , and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators . a special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles .
the british 16th air assault brigade ( later reinforced by royal marines ) formed the core of the force in southern afghanistan , along with troops and helicopters from australia , canada and the netherlands . the initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 british , 2,000 canadian , 1,400 from the netherlands and 240 from australia , along with special forces from denmark and estonia and small contingents from other nations . the monthly supply of cargo containers through pakistani route to isaf in afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around 12 billion in pakistani rupees .
in france , simultaneously , the towering figure of the gothic revival was eugène viollet-le-duc , who outdid historical gothic constructions to create a gothic as it ought to have been , notably at the fortified city of carcassonne in the south of france and in some richly fortified keeps for industrial magnates . viollet-le-duc compiled and coordinated an encyclopédie médiévale that was a rich repertory his contemporaries mined for architectural details . he effected vigorous restoration of crumbling detail of french cathedrals , including the abbey of saint-denis and famously at notre dame de paris , where many of whose most " gothic " gargoyles are viollet-le-duc 's . he taught a generation of reform-gothic designers and showed how to apply gothic style to modern structural materials , especially cast iron .
economists argue that one of the factors behind the differing economic development in africa and asia is that in africa , corruption has primarily taken the form of rent extraction with the resulting financial capital moved overseas rather than invested at home ( hence the stereotypical , but often accurate , image of african dictators having swiss bank accounts ) . in nigeria , for example , more than $ 400 billion was stolen from the treasury by nigeria 's leaders between 1960 and 1999 .

strasbourg is situated on the eastern border of france with germany . this border is formed by the river rhine , which also forms the eastern border of the modern city , facing across the river to the german town kehl . the historic core of strasbourg however lies on the grande île in the river ill , which here flows parallel to , and roughly 4 kilometres ( 2.5 mi ) from , the rhine . the natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of strasbourg , although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city .
between 1832 and 2002 the currency of greece was the drachma . after signing the maastricht treaty , greece applied to join the eurozone . the two main convergence criteria were a maximum budget deficit of 3 % of gdp and a declining public debt if it stood above 60 % of gdp . greece met the criteria as shown in its 1999 annual public account . on 1 january 2001 , greece joined the eurozone , with the adoption of the euro at the fixed exchange rate ₯340.75 to €1 . however , in 2001 the euro only existed electronically , so the physical exchange from drachma to euro only took place on 1 january 2002 . this was followed by a ten-year period for eligible exchange of drachma to euro , which ended on 1 march 2012 .
in april 1950 , stalin gave kim permission to invade the south under the condition that mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed . stalin made it clear that soviet forces would not openly engage in combat , to avoid a direct war with the americans . kim met with mao in may 1950 . mao was concerned that the americans would intervene but agreed to support the north korean invasion . china desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the soviets . at that time , the chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the pla 's 5.6 million soldiers . however , mao sent more ethnic korean pla veterans to korea and promised to move an army closer to the korean border . once mao 's commitment was secured , preparations for war accelerated .
roman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals . some lasted several days , others a single day or less : sacred days ( dies fasti ) outnumbered " non-sacred " days ( dies nefasti ) . a comparison of surviving roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions . some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi ( " games , " such as chariot races and theatrical performances ) , with examples including those held at palestrina in honour of fortuna primigenia during compitalia , and the ludi romani in honour of liber . other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes , or particular groups , such as women at the bona dea rites .

the events of the franco-prussian war had great influence on military thinking over the next forty years . lessons drawn from the war included the need for a general staff system , the scale and duration of future wars and the tactical use of artillery and cavalry . the bold use of artillery by the prussians , to silence french guns at long range and then to directly support infantry attacks at close range , proved to be superior to the defensive doctrine employed by french gunners . the prussian tactics were adopted by european armies by 1914 , exemplified in the french 75 , an artillery piece optimised to provide direct fire support to advancing infantry . most european armies ignored the evidence of the russo-japanese war of 1904–05 which suggested that infantry armed with new smokeless-powder rifles could engage gun crews effectively . this forced gunners to fire at longer range using indirect fire , usually from a position of cover .

hunting big game typically requires a " tag " for each animal harvested . tags must be purchased in addition to the hunting license , and the number of tags issued to an individual is typically limited . in cases where there are more prospective hunters than the quota for that species , tags are usually assigned by lottery . tags may be further restricted to a specific area , or wildlife management unit . hunting migratory waterfowl requires a duck stamp from the fish and wildlife service in addition to the appropriate state hunting license .
in 2008 [ update ] the total number of full-time equivalent jobs was 125,037 . the number of jobs in the primary sector was 203 , of which 184 were in agriculture and 19 were in forestry or lumber production . the number of jobs in the secondary sector was 15,476 of which 7,650 or ( 49.4 % ) were in manufacturing , 51 or ( 0.3 % ) were in mining and 6,389 ( 41.3 % ) were in construction . the number of jobs in the tertiary sector was 109,358 . in the tertiary sector ; 11,396 or 10.4 % were in wholesale or retail sales or the repair of motor vehicles , 10,293 or 9.4 % were in the movement and storage of goods , 5,090 or 4.7 % were in a hotel or restaurant , 7,302 or 6.7 % were in the information industry , 8,437 or 7.7 % were the insurance or financial industry , 10,660 or 9.7 % were technical professionals or scientists , 5,338 or 4.9 % were in education and 17,903 or 16.4 % were in health care .
the city and surrounding area suffered the bulk of the economic damage and largest loss of human life in the aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 attacks when 10 of the 19 terrorists associated with al-qaeda piloted american airlines flight 11 into the north tower of the world trade center and united airlines flight 175 into the south tower of the world trade center , and later destroyed them , killing 2,192 civilians , 343 firefighters , and 71 law enforcement officers who were in the towers and in the surrounding area . the rebuilding of the area , has created a new one world trade center , and a 9/11 memorial and museum along with other new buildings and infrastructure . the world trade center path station , which opened on july 19 , 1909 as the hudson terminal , was also destroyed in the attack . a temporary station was built and opened on november 23 , 2003 . a permanent station , the world trade center transportation hub , is currently under construction . the new one world trade center is the tallest skyscraper in the western hemisphere and the fourth-tallest building in the world by pinnacle height , with its spire reaching a symbolic 1,776 feet ( 541.3 m ) in reference to the year of american independence .
as a result , in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc . led by engineers kees schouhamer immink and toshitada doi , the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology . after a year of experimentation and discussion , the task force produced the red book cd-da standard . first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 .
honors and tributes flowed to bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew . bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities , to the point that the requests almost became burdensome . during his life he also received dozens of major awards , medals and other tributes . these included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created , notably the bell telephone memorial erected in his honor in alexander graham bell gardens in brantford , ontario , in 1917 .
jehovah 's witnesses believe that jesus christ began to rule in heaven as king of god 's kingdom in october 1914 , and that satan was subsequently ousted from heaven to the earth , resulting in " woe " to humanity . they believe that jesus rules invisibly , from heaven , perceived only as a series of " signs " . they base this belief on a rendering of the greek word parousia—usually translated as " coming " when referring to christ—as " presence " . they believe jesus ' presence includes an unknown period beginning with his inauguration as king in heaven in 1914 , and ending when he comes to bring a final judgment against humans on earth . they thus depart from the mainstream christian belief that the " second coming " of matthew 24 refers to a single moment of arrival on earth to judge humans .
bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics , which are classified as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria , or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth . there are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host . an example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin , which inhibit the bacterial ribosome , but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome . antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth , where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations . infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe , and by proper care of indwelling catheters . surgical and dental instruments are also sterilized to prevent contamination by bacteria . disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection .
kievan rus ' , although sparsely populated compared to western europe , was not only the largest contemporary european state in terms of area but also culturally advanced . literacy in kiev , novgorod and other large cities was high . as birch bark documents attest , they exchanged love letters and prepared cheat sheets for schools . novgorod had a sewage system and wood paving not often found in other cities at the time . the russkaya pravda confined punishments to fines and generally did not use capital punishment . certain rights were accorded to women , such as property and inheritance rights .
doubly fed electric motors have two independent multiphase winding sets , which contribute active ( i.e. , working ) power to the energy conversion process , with at least one of the winding sets electronically controlled for variable speed operation . two independent multiphase winding sets ( i.e. , dual armature ) are the maximum provided in a single package without topology duplication . doubly-fed electric motors are machines with an effective constant torque speed range that is twice synchronous speed for a given frequency of excitation . this is twice the constant torque speed range as singly-fed electric machines , which have only one active winding set .
the united states air force has had numerous recruiting slogans including " no one comes close " and uno ab alto ( " one from on high " ) . for many years , the u.s. air force used " aim high " as its recruiting slogan ; more recently , they have used " cross into the blue " , " we 've been waiting for you " and " do something amazing " , " above all " , and the newest one , as of 7 october 2010 , considered a call and response , " aim high " followed with the response , " fly-fight-win " each wing , group , or squadron usually has its own slogan ( s ) . information and logos can usually be found on the wing , group , or squadron websites .
during the late 6th century bc , the first geographical entity that was called armenia by neighboring populations was established under the orontid dynasty within the achaemenid empire , as part of the latters ' territories . the kingdom became fully sovereign from the sphere of influence of the seleucid empire in 190 bc under king artaxias i and begun the rule of the artaxiad dynasty . armenia reached its height between 95 and 66 bc under tigranes the great , becoming the most powerful kingdom of its time east of the roman republic .
music is cherished in boston . the boston symphony orchestra is one of the " big five , " a group of the greatest american orchestras , and the classical music magazine gramophone called it one of the " world 's best " orchestras . symphony hall ( located west of back bay ) is home to the boston symphony orchestra , ( and the related boston youth symphony orchestra , which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation ) and the boston pops orchestra . the british newspaper the guardian called boston symphony hall " one of the top venues for classical music in the world , " adding that " symphony hall in boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design . " other concerts are held at the new england conservatory 's jordan hall . the boston ballet performs at the boston opera house . other performing-arts organizations located in the city include the boston lyric opera company , opera boston , boston baroque ( the first permanent baroque orchestra in the us ) , and the handel and haydn society ( one of the oldest choral companies in the united states ) . the city is a center for contemporary classical music with a number of performing groups , several of which are associated with the city 's conservatories and universities . these include the boston modern orchestra project and boston musica viva . several theaters are located in or near the theater district south of boston common , including the cutler majestic theatre , citi performing arts center , the colonial theater , and the orpheum theatre .
the houston–the woodlands–sugar land metropolitan area is served by one public television station and two public radio stations . kuht ( houstonpbs ) is a pbs member station and is the first public television station in the united states . houston public radio is listener-funded and comprises two npr member stations : kuhf ( kuhf news ) and kuha ( classical 91.7 ) . kuhf is news/talk radio and kuha is a classical music station . the university of houston system owns and holds broadcasting licenses to kuht , kuhf , and kuha . the stations broadcast from the melcher center for public broadcasting , located on the campus of the university of houston .
in 2007 , gametrailers named the snes as the second-best console of all time in their list of top ten consoles that " left their mark on the history of gaming " , citing its graphic , sound , and library of top-quality games . in 2015 , they also named it the best nintendo console of all time , saying , " the list of games we love from this console completely annihilates any other roster from the big n. " technology columnist don reisinger proclaimed " the snes is the greatest console of all time " in january 2008 , citing the quality of the games and the console 's dramatic improvement over its predecessor ; fellow technology columnist will greenwald replied with a more nuanced view , giving the snes top marks with his heart , the nes with his head , and the playstation ( for its controller ) with his hands . gamingexcellence also gave the snes first place in 2008 , declaring it " simply the most timeless system ever created " with many games that stand the test of time and citing its innovation in controller design , graphics capabilities , and game storytelling . at the same time , gamedaily rated it fifth of ten for its graphics , audio , controllers , and games . in 2009 , ign named the super nintendo entertainment system the fourth best video game console , complimenting its audio and " concentration of aaa titles " .
in 2004 , philosopher and psychologist michel ter hark ( groningen , the netherlands ) published a book , called popper , otto selz and the rise of evolutionary epistemology , in which he claimed that popper took some of his ideas from his tutor , the german psychologist otto selz . selz never published his ideas , partly because of the rise of nazism , which forced him to quit his work in 1933 , and the prohibition of referring to selz ' work . popper , the historian of ideas and his scholarship , is criticised in some academic quarters for his rejection of plato , hegel and marx .
royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies . in the united kingdom , for instance , the sovereign may appear personally in the house of lords or may appoint lords commissioners , who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the palace of westminster . however , royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent . in other nations , such as australia , the governor-general merely signs the bill . in canada , the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of his or her agreement to the bill .
the ismailis differ from twelvers because they had living imams for centuries after the last twelver imam went into concealment . they followed isma'il ibn jafar , elder brother of musa al-kadhim , as the rightful imam after his father ja'far al-sadiq . the ismailis believe that whether imam ismail did or did not die before imam ja'far , he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son muḥammad ibn ismail as the next imam . thus , their line of imams is as follows ( the years of their individual imamats during the common era are given in brackets ) :
the usaf is the only branch of the u.s. military where nco status is achieved when an enlisted person reaches the pay grade of e-5 . in all other branches , nco status is generally achieved at the pay grade of e-4 ( e.g. , a corporal in the army and marine corps , petty officer third class in the navy and coast guard ) . the air force mirrored the army from 1976 to 1991 with an e-4 being either a senior airman wearing three stripes without a star or a sergeant ( referred to as " buck sergeant " ) , which was noted by the presence of the central star and considered an nco . despite not being an nco , a senior airman who has completed airman leadership school can be a supervisor according to the afi 36-2618 .
on the east side of the main park area is the national museum of visual arts . on this side , a very popular street market takes place every sunday . on the north side is an artificial lake with a little castle housing a municipal library for children . an area to its west is used as an open-air exhibition of photography . west of the park , across the coastal avenue rambla presidente wilson , stretches ramirez beach . directly west of the main park are , and belonging to parque rodó barrio , is the former parque hotel , now called edifício mercosur , seat of the parliament of the members countries of the mercosur . during the guerilla war the tupamaros frequently attacked buildings in this area , including the old hotel .
the old swiss confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars , but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in 1515 with the swiss defeat in the battle of marignano . this ended the so-called " heroic " epoch of swiss history . the success of zwingli 's reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ( wars of kappel ) . it was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that , in 1648 , under the peace of westphalia , european countries recognized switzerland 's independence from the holy roman empire and its neutrality .
capital punishment has existed in tennessee at various times since statehood . before 1913 the method of execution was hanging . from 1913 to 1915 there was a hiatus on executions but they were reinstated in 1916 when electrocution became the new method . from 1972 to 1978 , after the supreme court ruled ( furman v. georgia ) capital punishment unconstitutional , there were no further executions . capital punishment was restarted in 1978 , although those prisoners awaiting execution between 1960 and 1978 had their sentences mostly commuted to life in prison . from 1916 to 1960 the state executed 125 inmates . for a variety of reasons there were no further executions until 2000 . since 2000 , tennessee has executed six prisoners and has 73 prisoners on death row ( as of april 2015 ) .
as of 2012 [ update ] , there are over 3.5 million vehicles operating in the city , of which 74 % are two-wheelers , 15 % cars and 3 % three-wheelers . the remaining 8 % include buses , goods vehicles and taxis . the large number of vehicles coupled with relatively low road coverage—roads occupy only 9.5 % of the total city area:79—has led to widespread traffic congestion especially since 80 % of passengers and 60 % of freight are transported by road . :3 the inner ring road , the outer ring road , the hyderabad elevated expressway , the longest flyover in india , and various interchanges , overpasses and underpasses were built to ease the congestion . maximum speed limits within the city are 50 km/h ( 31 mph ) for two-wheelers and cars , 35 km/h ( 22 mph ) for auto rickshaws and 40 km/h ( 25 mph ) for light commercial vehicles and buses .
during the post-world war i period ski-lifts were built in swiss and austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors , but summer tourism continued to be important ; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in france devoted almost exclusively to skiing , such as les menuires . until this point austria and switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports , but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century , france , italy and the tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors . from 1980 to the present , ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts , leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline .
at the beginning of the three kingdoms era ( 220–280 ce ) , zhejiang was home to the warlords yan baihu and wang lang prior to their defeat by sun ce and sun quan , who eventually established the kingdom of wu . despite the removal of their court from kuaiji to jianye ( present-day nanjing ) , they continued development of the region and benefitted from influxes of refugees fleeing the turmoil in northern china . industrial kilns were established and trade reached as far as manchuria and funan ( south vietnam ) .
prior to einstein 's paper , electromagnetic radiation such as visible light was considered to behave as a wave : hence the use of the terms " frequency " and " wavelength " to characterise different types of radiation . the energy transferred by a wave in a given time is called its intensity . the light from a theatre spotlight is more intense than the light from a domestic lightbulb ; that is to say that the spotlight gives out more energy per unit time and per unit space ( and hence consumes more electricity ) than the ordinary bulb , even though the colour of the light might be very similar . other waves , such as sound or the waves crashing against a seafront , also have their own intensity . however , the energy account of the photoelectric effect did n't seem to agree with the wave description of light .
these ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of the football association ( the fa ) in 1863 , which first met on the morning of 26 october 1863 at the freemasons ' tavern in great queen street , london . the only school to be represented on this occasion was charterhouse . the freemason 's tavern was the setting for five more meetings between october and december , which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules . at the final meeting , the first fa treasurer , the representative from blackheath , withdrew his club from the fa over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting : the first allowed for running with the ball in hand ; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking ( kicking an opponent in the shins ) , tripping and holding . other english rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the fa and instead in 1871 formed the rugby football union . the eleven remaining clubs , under the charge of ebenezer cobb morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game . these rules included handling of the ball by " marks " and the lack of a crossbar , rules which made it remarkably similar to victorian rules football being developed at that time in australia . the sheffield fa played by its own rules until the 1870s with the fa absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games .
two annual productions are especially notable : the waa-mu show , and the dolphin show . waa-mu is an original musical , written and produced almost entirely by students . children 's theater is represented on campus by griffin 's tale and purple crayon players . its umbrella organization—the student theatre coalition , or stuco , organizes nine student theatre companies , multiple performance groups and more than sixty independent productions each year . many northwestern alumni have used these productions as stepping stones to successful television and film careers . chicago 's lookingglass theatre company , for example , which began life in the great room in jones residential college , was founded in 1988 by several alumni , including david schwimmer ; in 2011 , it won the regional tony award .
season eleven , however , suffered a steep drop in ratings , a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as the voice and the x-factor . the ratings for the first two episodes of season eleven fell 16–21 % in overall viewer numbers and 24–27 % in the 18/49 demo , while the season finale fell 27 % in total viewer number and 30 % in the 18-49 demo . the average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003 , a drop of 23 % in total viewers and 30 % in the 18/49 demo . for the first time in eight years , american idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo , coming in second to nbc sunday night football , although the strengths of idol in its second year in the wednesday-thursday primetime slots helped fox achieve the longest period of 18-49 demographic victory in the nielsen ratings , standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012 .
despite losing fan favorite grace to free agency , and the lack of production from newcomer todd hundley , skipper don baylor 's cubs put together a good season in 2001 . the season started with mack newton being brought in to preach " positive thinking . " one of the biggest stories of the season transpired as the club made a midseason deal for fred mcgriff , which was drawn out for nearly a month as mcgriff debated waiving his no-trade clause , as the cubs led the wild card race by 2.5 games in early september . that run died when preston wilson hit a three run walk off homer off of closer tom " flash " gordon , which halted the team 's momentum . the team was unable to make another serious charge , and finished at 88–74 , five games behind both houston and st. louis , who tied for first . sosa had perhaps his finest season and jon lieber led the staff with a 20 win season .
the british mandate of palestine , where an arab majority lived alongside a jewish minority , presented the british with a similar problem to that of india . the matter was complicated by large numbers of jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to palestine following the holocaust , while arabs were opposed to the creation of a jewish state . frustrated by the intractability of the problem , attacks by jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence , britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the united nations to solve . the un general assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition palestine into a jewish and an arab state .
in an operational capacity , limitations in weapons technology and quick british reactions were making it more difficult to achieve strategic effect . attacking ports , shipping and imports as well as disrupting rail traffic in the surrounding areas , especially the distribution of coal , an important fuel in all industrial economies of the second world war , would net a positive result . however , the use of delayed-action bombs , while initially very effective , gradually had less impact , partly because they failed to detonate . [ c ] moreover , the british had anticipated the change in strategy and dispersed its production facilities making them less vulnerable to a concentrated attack . regional commissioners were given plenipotentiary powers to restore communications and organise the distribution of supplies to keep the war economy moving .
stepper motors were and still are often used in computer printers , optical scanners , and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element , the print head carriage ( of dot matrix and inkjet printers ) , and the platen or feed rollers . likewise , many computer plotters ( which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers ) used rotary stepper motors for pen and platen movement ; the typical alternatives here were either linear stepper motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems .
even though the book had barely hinted at human evolution , it quickly became central to the debate as mental and moral qualities were seen as spiritual aspects of the immaterial soul , and it was believed that animals did not have spiritual qualities . this conflict could be reconciled by supposing there was some supernatural intervention on the path leading to humans , or viewing evolution as a purposeful and progressive ascent to mankind 's position at the head of nature . while many conservative theologians accepted evolution , charles hodge argued in his 1874 critique " what is darwinism ? " that " darwinism " , defined narrowly as including rejection of design , was atheism though he accepted that asa gray did not reject design . asa gray responded that this charge misrepresented darwin 's text . by the early 20th century , four noted authors of the fundamentals were explicitly open to the possibility that god created through evolution , but fundamentalism inspired the american creation–evolution controversy that began in the 1920s . some conservative roman catholic writers and influential jesuits opposed evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century , but other catholic writers , starting with mivart , pointed out that early church fathers had not interpreted genesis literally in this area . the vatican stated its official position in a 1950 papal encyclical , which held that evolution was not inconsistent with catholic teaching .
for its official works and publications , the united nations organization groups countries under a classification of regions . the assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories by the united nations . southern europe , as grouped for statistical convenience by the united nations ( the sub-regions according to the un ) , includes following countries and territories :
von neumann was a founding figure in computing . donald knuth cites von neumann as the inventor , in 1945 , of the merge sort algorithm , in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged . von neumann wrote the sorting program for the edvac in ink , being 23 pages long ; traces can still be seen on the first page of the phrase " top secret " , which was written in pencil and later erased . he also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with alan turing when the latter visited princeton in the 1930s .
a pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are republicanism ( or neo- or civic-republicanism ) and the capability approach . the resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from isaiah berlin 's positive and negative forms of liberty , namely " liberty as non-domination . " unlike liberals who understand liberty as " non-interference , " " non-domination " entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of anyother person . to a liberal , a slave who is not interfered with may be free , yet to a republican the mere status as a slave , regardless of how that slave is treated , is objectionable . prominent republicans include historian quentin skinner , jurist cass sunstein , and political philosopher philip pettit . the capability approach , pioneered by economists mahbub ul haq and amartya sen and further developed by legal scholar martha nussbaum , understands freedom under allied lines : the real-world ability to act . both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced . in other words , it is not enough to be legally able to do something , but to have the real option of doing it .
in september 2006 , german officials seized mp3 players from sandisk 's booth at the ifa show in berlin after an italian patents firm won an injunction on behalf of sisvel against sandisk in a dispute over licensing rights . the injunction was later reversed by a berlin judge , but that reversal was in turn blocked the same day by another judge from the same court , " bringing the patent wild west to germany " in the words of one commentator .
charleston 's oldest community theater group , the footlight players , has provided theatrical productions since 1931 . a variety of performing arts venues includes the historic dock street theatre . the annual charleston fashion week held each spring in marion square brings in designers , journalists , and clients from across the nation . charleston is known for its local seafood , which plays a key role in the city 's renowned cuisine , comprising staple dishes such as gumbo , she-crab soup , fried oysters , lowcountry boil , deviled crab cakes , red rice , and shrimp and grits . rice is the staple in many dishes , reflecting the rice culture of the low country . the cuisine in charleston is also strongly influenced by british and french elements .
the feminism and female empowerment themes on beyoncé 's second solo album b'day were inspired by her role in dreamgirls and by singer josephine baker . beyoncé paid homage to baker by performing " déjà vu " at the 2006 fashion rocks concert wearing baker 's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas . beyoncé 's third solo album i am ... sasha fierce was inspired by jay z and especially by etta james , whose " boldness " inspired beyoncé to explore other musical genres and styles . her fourth solo album , 4 , was inspired by fela kuti , 1990s r & b , earth , wind & fire , debarge , lionel richie , teena marie with additional influences by the jackson 5 , new edition , adele , florence and the machine , and prince .
the marshall islands are served by the marshall islands international airport in majuro , the bucholz army airfield in kwajalein , and other small airports and airstrips .
in the city the population was spread out with 25.7 % under the age of 18 , 8.9 % from 18 to 24 , 31.0 % from 25 to 44 , 20.2 % from 45 to 64 , and 14.2 % who were 65 years of age or older . the median age was 35 years . for every 100 females there were 96.1 males . for every 100 females age 18 and over , there were 93.2 males .
the banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back ; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually . when the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again . an increase in the quantity of notes offered at auction allows an increase in liquidity in the economy . a decrease has the contrary effect . the contracts are carried on the asset side of the european central bank 's balance sheet and the resulting deposits in member banks are carried as a liability . in layman terms , the liability of the central bank is money , and an increase in deposits in member banks , carried as a liability by the central bank , means that more money has been put into the economy .

bacteria are further divided into lithotrophs that use inorganic electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors . chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation ( by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation ) and biosynthetic reactions ( e.g. , carbon dioxide fixation ) , whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes . respiratory organisms use chemical compounds as a source of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction . this reaction releases energy that can be used to synthesise atp and drive metabolism . in aerobic organisms , oxygen is used as the electron acceptor . in anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds , such as nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors . this leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification , sulfate reduction , and acetogenesis , respectively .
west 's fourth studio album , 808s & heartbreak ( 2008 ) , marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases , largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis , the roland tr-808 drum machine , and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks . drawing inspiration from artists such as gary numan , tj swan and boy george , and maintaining a " minimal but functional " approach towards the album 's studio production , west explored the electronic feel produced by auto-tune and utilized the sounds created by the 808 , manipulating its pitch to produce a distorted , electronic sound ; he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks . the album 's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums , lengthy strings , droning synthesizers , and somber piano , and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s post-punk and new wave groups , with west himself later confessing an affinity with british post-punk group joy division . rolling stone journalist matthew trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article , " now that popular music has finally caught up to it , 808s & heartbreak has revealed itself to be kanye ’ s most vulnerable work , and perhaps his most brilliant . "
politically , the marshall islands is a presidential republic in free association with the united states , with the us providing defense , subsidies , and access to u.s. based agencies such as the fcc and the usps . with few natural resources , the islands ' wealth is based on a service economy , as well as some fishing and agriculture ; aid from the united states represents a large percentage of the islands ' gross domestic product . the country uses the united states dollar as its currency .
three germanic dialects were originally spoken in the low countries : frisian in the north and along the western coast ; saxon in the east ( contiguous with the low german area ) ; and franconian in the centre and south . it is the franconian dialects that is designated as old dutch , and that would develop in middle dutch and later modern dutch . the division in these development phases is mostly conventional , since the transition between them was very gradual . one of the few moments linguists can detect somewhat of a revolution is when the dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself . the development of the dutch language is illustrated by the following sentence in old , middle and modern dutch :
provided some additional requirements are met ( e.g . providing an authoritative statement of the archivist ) , the united states patent office and the european patent office will accept date stamps from the internet archive as evidence of when a given web page was accessible to the public . these dates are used to determine if a web page is available as prior art for instance in examining a patent application .
an exception to the usual european qualification system happened in 2005 , after liverpool won the champions league the year before , but did not finish in a champions league qualification place in the premier league that season . uefa gave special dispensation for liverpool to enter the champions league , giving england five qualifiers . uefa subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing . however , for those leagues with four entrants in the champions league , this meant that if the champions league winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league , it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league . no association can have more than four entrants in the champions league . this occurred in 2012 , when chelsea – who had won the champions league the previous year , but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the champions league in place of tottenham hotspur , who went into the europa league .
a number of theories have been proposed regarding avicenna 's madhab ( school of thought within islamic jurisprudence ) . medieval historian ẓahīr al-dīn al-bayhaqī ( d. 1169 ) considered avicenna to be a follower of the brethren of purity . on the other hand , dimitri gutas along with aisha khan and jules j. janssens demonstrated that avicenna was a sunni hanafi . however , the 14th cenutry shia faqih nurullah shushtari according to seyyed hossein nasr , maintained that he was most likely a twelver shia . conversely , sharaf khorasani , citing a rejection of an invitation of the sunni governor sultan mahmoud ghazanavi by avicenna to his court , believes that avicenna was an ismaili . similar disagreements exist on the background of avicenna 's family , whereas some writers considered them sunni , some more recent writers contested that they were shia .
orientalist scholars of the 18th century like sir william jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for indian culture and for sanskrit . according to thomas trautmann , after this period of " indomania " , a certain hostility to sanskrit and to indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century britain , manifested by a neglect of sanskrit in british academia . this was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that india should be culturally , religiously and linguistically assimilated to britain as far as possible . trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility : one was " british indophobia " , which he calls essentially a developmentalist , progressivist , liberal , and non-racial-essentialist critique of hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of india along european lines ; the other was scientific racism , a theory of the english " common-sense view " that indians constituted a " separate , inferior and unimprovable race " .

richmond has several historic churches . because of its early english colonial history from the early 17th century to 1776 , richmond has a number of prominent anglican/episcopal churches including monumental church , st. paul 's episcopal church and st. john 's episcopal church . methodists and baptists made up another section of early churches , and first baptist church of richmond was the first of these , established in 1780 . in the reformed church tradition , the first presbyterian church in the city of richmond was first presbyterian church , organized on june 18 , 1812 . on february 5 , 1845 , second presbyterian church of richmond was founded , which was a historic church where stonewall jackson attended and was the first gothic building and the first gas-lit church to be built in richmond . st. peter 's church was dedicated and became the first catholic church in richmond on may 25 , 1834 . the city is also home to the historic cathedral of the sacred heart which is the motherchurch for the roman catholic diocese of richmond .
in styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic , street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork . the most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the french invader . he has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles , the first of which are small " traditional " tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character , installed in cities across the globe , and the second of which are a style he refers to as " rubikcubism " , which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled rubik 's cubes . although he is the most prominent , other street and urban artists do work in mosaic styles as well .

saint helena was first settled by the english in 1659 , and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants , mainly descended from people from britain – settlers ( " planters " ) and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from africa ( the cape verde islands , gold coast and west coast of africa are mentioned in early records ) , then india and madagascar . eventually the planters felt there were too many slaves and no more were imported after 1792 .
cytokinins are a class of plant hormones named for their control of cell division or cytokinesis . the natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn , zea mays , and is a derivative of the purine adenine . zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division , bud development , and the greening of chloroplasts . the gibberelins , such as gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl coa via the mevalonate pathway . they are involved in the promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds , in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering . abscisic acid ( aba ) occurs in all land plants except liverworts , and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids . it inhibits cell division , promotes seed maturation , and dormancy , and promotes stomatal closure . it was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission . ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine . it is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission , and it , or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene , are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton , pineapples and other climacteric crops .
victoria was pleased when gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated . she thought his government was " the worst i have ever had " , and blamed him for the death of general gordon at khartoum . gladstone was replaced by lord salisbury . salisbury 's government only lasted a few months , however , and victoria was forced to recall gladstone , whom she referred to as a " half crazy & really in many ways ridiculous old man " . gladstone attempted to pass a bill granting ireland home rule , but to victoria 's glee it was defeated . in the ensuing election , gladstone 's party lost to salisbury 's and the government switched hands again .
as of 2013 , the global advertising agencies of omnicom group and interpublic group , both based in manhattan , had combined annual revenues of approximately us $ 21 billion , reflecting new york city 's role as the top global center for the advertising industry , which is metonymously referred to as " madison avenue " . the city 's fashion industry provides approximately 180,000 employees with $ 11 billion in annual wages .
in 1974 , the unmanned astroflight sunrise plane made the first solar flight . on 29 april 1979 , the solar riser made the first flight in a solar-powered , fully controlled , man carrying flying machine , reaching an altitude of 40 feet ( 12 m ) . in 1980 , the gossamer penguin made the first piloted flights powered solely by photovoltaics . this was quickly followed by the solar challenger which crossed the english channel in july 1981 . in 1990 eric scott raymond in 21 hops flew from california to north carolina using solar power . developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles ( uav ) with the pathfinder ( 1997 ) and subsequent designs , culminating in the helios which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at 29,524 metres ( 96,864 ft ) in 2001 . the zephyr , developed by bae systems , is the latest in a line of record-breaking solar aircraft , making a 54-hour flight in 2007 , and month-long flights were envisioned by 2010 . as of 2015 , solar impulse , an electric aircraft , is currently circumnavigating the globe . it is a single-seat plane powered by solar cells and capable of taking off under its own power . the designed allows the aircraft to remain airborne for 36 hours .
on april 18 , 1985 , a few months after taking his senate seat , kerry and senator tom harkin of iowa traveled to nicaragua and met the country 's president , daniel ortega . though ortega had won internationally certified elections , the trip was criticized because ortega and his leftist sandinista government had strong ties to cuba and the ussr and were accused of human rights abuses . the sandinista government was opposed by the right-wing cia-backed rebels known as the contras . while in nicaragua , kerry and harkin talked to people on both sides of the conflict . through the senators , ortega offered a cease-fire agreement in exchange for the u.s. dropping support of the contras . the offer was denounced by the reagan administration as a " propaganda initiative " designed to influence a house vote on a $ 14 million contra aid package , but kerry said " i am willing ... .. to take the risk in the effort to put to test the good faith of the sandinistas . " the house voted down the contra aid , but ortega flew to moscow to accept a $ 200 million loan the next day , which in part prompted the house to pass a larger $ 27 million aid package six weeks later .
one of the early anthemic tunes , " promised land " by joe smooth , was covered and charted within a week by the style council . europeans embraced house , and began booking legendary american house djs to play at the big clubs , such as ministry of sound , whose resident , justin berkmann brought in larry levan .
in the following two decades after sianis ' ill will , the cubs played mostly forgettable baseball , finishing among the worst teams in the national league on an almost annual basis . longtime infielder/manager phil cavarretta , who had been a key player during the '45 season , was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place . although shortstop ernie banks would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade , finding help for him proved a difficult task , as quality players such as hank sauer were few and far between . this , combined with poor ownership decisions such as the college of coaches , and the ill-fated trade of future hall of famer lou brock to the cardinals for pitcher ernie broglio ( who won only 7 games over the next three seasons ) , hampered on-field performance .
serotonin is a neuromodulator involved in regulation of mood and behavior . development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information . changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress . the corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents ' vulnerability . the effect of serotonin is not limited to the limbic system : several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence , particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex .
lewis latimer , employed at the time by edison , developed an improved method of heat-treating carbon filaments which reduced breakage and allowed them to be molded into novel shapes , such as the characteristic " m " shape of maxim filaments . on 17 january 1882 , latimer received a patent for the " process of manufacturing carbons " , an improved method for the production of light bulb filaments , which was purchased by the united states electric light company . latimer patented other improvements such as a better way of attaching filaments to their wire supports .
faced with the stripping of their powers , wu sangui , later joined by geng zhongming and by shang kexi 's son shang zhixin , felt they had no choice but to revolt . the ensuing revolt of the three feudatories lasted for eight years . wu attempted , ultimately in vain , to fire the embers of south china ming loyalty by restoring ming customs , ordering that the resented queues be cut , and declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty . at the peak of the rebels ' fortunes , they extended their control as far north as the yangtze river , nearly establishing a divided china . wu then hesitated to go further north , not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies , and kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of manchu generals . by 1681 , the qing government had established control over a ravaged southern china which took several decades to recover . manchu generals and bannermen were initially put to shame by the better performance of the han chinese green standard army , who fought better than them against the rebels and this was noted by kangxi , leading him to task generals sun sike , wang jinbao , and zhao liangdong to lead green standard soldiers to crush the rebels . the qing thought that han chinese were superior at battling other han people and so used the green standard army as the dominant and majority army in crushing the rebels instead of bannermen . similarly , in northwestern china against wang fuchen , the qing used han chinese green standard army soldiers and han chinese generals such as zhang liangdong , wang jinbao , and zhang yong as the primary military forces . this choice was due to the rocky terrain , which favoured infantry troops over cavalry , to the desire to keep bannermen in the reserves , and , again , to the belief that han troops were better at fighting other han people . these han generals achieved victory over the rebels . also due to the mountainous terrain , sichuan and southern shaanxi were also retaken by the han chinese green standard army under wang jinbao and zhao liangdong in 1680 , with manchus only participating in dealing with logistics and provisions . 400,000 green standard army soldiers and 150,000 bannermen served on the qing side during the war . 213 han chinese banner companies , and 527 companies of mongol and manchu banners were mobilized by the qing during the revolt . 400,000 green standard army soldiers were used against the three feudatories besides 200,000 bannermen .
at the start of a classic valley glacier is a bowl-shaped cirque , which has escarped walls on three sides but is open on the side that descends into the valley . cirques are where ice begins to accumulate in a glacier . two glacial cirques may form back to back and erode their backwalls until only a narrow ridge , called an arête is left . this structure may result in a mountain pass . if multiple cirques encircle a single mountain , they create pointed pyramidal peaks ; particularly steep examples are called horns .
the propagation of universities was not necessarily a steady progression , as the 17th century was rife with events that adversely affected university expansion . many wars , and especially the thirty years ' war , disrupted the university landscape throughout europe at different times . war , plague , famine , regicide , and changes in religious power and structure often adversely affected the societies that provided support for universities . internal strife within the universities themselves , such as student brawling and absentee professors , acted to destabilize these institutions as well . universities were also reluctant to give up older curricula , and the continued reliance on the works of aristotle defied contemporary advancements in science and the arts . this era was also affected by the rise of the nation-state . as universities increasingly came under state control , or formed under the auspices of the state , the faculty governance model ( begun by the university of paris ) became more and more prominent . although the older student-controlled universities still existed , they slowly started to move toward this structural organization . control of universities still tended to be independent , although university leadership was increasingly appointed by the state .
zhejiang was the site of the neolithic cultures of the hemudu and liangzhu . a 2007 analysis of the dna recovered from human remains in the archeological sites of prehistoric peoples along the yangtze river shows high frequencies of haplogroup o1 in the liangzhu culture , linking them to austronesian and tai-kadai peoples .
during the regency of maria cristina , espartero ruled spain for two years as its 18th prime minister from 16 september 1840 to 21 may 1841 . under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies . during this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the church , its congregations , and its religious orders were national property—though in valencia , most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie . city life in valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate , with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans , and the constant threat of reprisals by the carlist troops of general cabrera .
the basic law of the federal republic of germany , the federal constitution , stipulates that the structure of each federal state 's government must " conform to the principles of republican , democratic , and social government , based on the rule of law " ( article 28 ) . most of the states are governed by a cabinet led by a ministerpräsident ( minister-president ) , together with a unicameral legislative body known as the landtag ( state diet ) . the states are parliamentary republics and the relationship between their legislative and executive branches mirrors that of the federal system : the legislatures are popularly elected for four or five years ( depending on the state ) , and the minister-president is then chosen by a majority vote among the landtag 's members . the minister-president appoints a cabinet to run the state 's agencies and to carry out the executive duties of the state 's government .
it has been pointed out that khmer and indonesian classical arts were concerned with depicting the life of the gods , but to the southeast asian mind the life of the gods was the life of the peoples themselves—joyous , earthy , yet divine . the tai , coming late into southeast asia , brought with them some chinese artistic traditions , but they soon shed them in favour of the khmer and mon traditions , and the only indications of their earlier contact with chinese arts were in the style of their temples , especially the tapering roof , and in their lacquerware .
there are many innovative art galleries in the city . the southampton city art gallery at the civic centre is one of the best known and as well as a nationally important designated collection , houses several permanent and travelling exhibitions . the millais gallery at southampton solent university , the john hansard gallery at southampton university as well as smaller galleries including the art house in above bar street provide a different view . the city 's bargate is also an art gallery run by the arts organisation " a space " . a space also run the art vaults project , which creatively uses several of southampton 's medieval vaults , halls and cellars as venues for contemporary art installations .
formed in 1878 , everton were founding members of the football league in 1888 and won their first league championship two seasons later . following four league titles and two fa cup wins , everton experienced a lull in the immediate post world war two period until a revival in the 1960s which saw the club win two league championships and an fa cup . the mid-1980s represented their most recent period of sustained success , with two league championship successes , an fa cup , and the 1985 european cup winners ' cup . the club 's most recent major trophy was the 1995 fa cup . the club 's supporters are known as evertonians .
when modern architecture was first practiced , it was an avant-garde movement with moral , philosophical , and aesthetic underpinnings . immediately after world war i , pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order , focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes . they rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order . the approach of the modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms , removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details . buildings displayed their functional and structural elements , exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms .
in the late 12th and early 13th centuries the border and political relationship between england and scotland was disputed , with the kings of scotland claiming parts of what is now northern england . john 's father , henry ii , had forced william the lion to swear fealty to him at the treaty of falaise in 1174 . this had been rescinded by richard i in exchange for financial compensation in 1189 , but the relationship remained uneasy . john began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties . he refused william 's request for the earldom of northumbria , but did not intervene in scotland itself and focused on his continental problems . the two kings maintained a friendly relationship , meeting in 1206 and 1207 , until it was rumoured in 1209 that william was intending to ally himself with philip ii of france . john invaded scotland and forced william to sign the treaty of norham , which gave john control of william 's daughters and required a payment of £10,000 . this effectively crippled william 's power north of the border , and by 1212 john had to intervene militarily to support the scottish king against his internal rivals . [ nb 16 ] john made no efforts to reinvigorate the treaty of falaise , though , and both william and alexander remained independent kings , supported by , but not owing fealty to , john .
a national university is generally a university created or run by a national state but at the same time represents a state autonomic institution which functions as a completely independent body inside of the same state . some national universities are closely associated with national cultural or political aspirations , for instance the national university of ireland in the early days of irish independence collected a large amount of information on the irish language and irish culture . reforms in argentina were the result of the university revolution of 1918 and its posterior reforms by incorporating values that sought for a more equal and laic higher education system .
the current chief of the defence staff , the professional head of the british armed forces , is general sir nicholas houghton , late green howards . he is supported by the vice chief of the defence staff , by the professional heads of the three services of hm armed forces and by the commander of joint forces command .
in 1896 , eugen baumann observed iodine in thyroid glands . in 1897 , christiaan eijkman worked with natives of java , who also suffered from beriberi . eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact . eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice , discovering that food can cure disease . over two decades later , nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin b1 , also known as thiamine .
on november 2011 , the sailing boat puma 's mar mostro participant in volvo ocean race arrived to the island after her mast broke in the first leg from alicante and cape town . this event made the island , its inhabitants and lifestyle known worldwide thanks to the media reports .
scientists have been studying the impact of climate change and water use . for example , each year more water is diverted from rivers for snowmaking in the ski resorts , the effect of which is yet unknown . furthermore , the decrease of glaciated areas combined with a succession of winters with lower-than-expected precipitation may have a future impact on the rivers in the alps as well as an effect on the water availability to the lowlands .
commercial turkeys are usually reared indoors under controlled conditions . these are often large buildings , purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities ( this reduces the birds ' activity and thereby increases the rate of weight gain ) . the lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day , or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly . females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19 . mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts . many different breeds have been developed , but the majority of commercial birds are white , as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass , the pin feathers being less visible . turkeys were at one time mainly consumed on special occasions such as christmas ( 10 million birds in the united kingdom ) or thanksgiving ( 60 million birds in the united states ) . however , they are increasingly becoming part of the everyday diet in many parts of the world .
hopkins ' column also drew criticism on twitter , including from russell brand , to whom hopkins responded by accusing brand 's " champagne socialist humanity " of neglecting taxpayers . simon usborne , writing in the independent , compared her use of the word " cockroach " to previous uses by the nazis and just before the rwandan genocide by its perpetrators . he suspected that if any other contributor had written the piece it would not have been published and questioned her continued employment by the newspaper . zoe williams commented in the guardian : " it is no joke when people start talking like this . we are not 'giving her what she wants ' when we make manifest our disgust . it is not a free speech issue . i ’ m not saying gag her : i ’ m saying fight her " .
over the years , the mughals began to have internal disputes which greatly distracted them at times . the mughal empire continued to weaken , and with the decline of the mughal empire in the 18th century , rajputana came under the suzerainty of the marathas . the marathas , who were hindus from the state of what is now maharashtra , ruled rajputana for most of the eighteenth century . the maratha empire , which had replaced the mughal empire as the overlord of the subcontinent , was finally replaced by the british empire in 1818 .
the earliest dynastic king on the sumerian king list whose name is known from any other legendary source is etana , 13th king of the first dynasty of kish . the earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is enmebaragesi of kish ( c. 26th century bc ) , whose name is also mentioned in the gilgamesh epic—leading to the suggestion that gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of uruk . as the epic of gilgamesh shows , this period was associated with increased war . cities became walled , and increased in size as undefended villages in southern mesopotamia disappeared . ( gilgamesh is credited with having built the walls of uruk ) .
dutch is one of the closest relatives of both german and english [ n 5 ] and is said to be roughly in between them . [ n 6 ] dutch , like english , has not undergone the high german consonant shift , does not use germanic umlaut as a grammatical marker , has largely abandoned the use of the subjunctive , and has levelled much of its morphology , including the case system . [ n 7 ] features shared with german include the survival of three grammatical genders—albeit with few grammatical consequences [ n 8 ] —as well as the use of modal particles , final-obstruent devoicing , and a similar word order . [ n 9 ] dutch vocabulary is mostly germanic and incorporates more romance loans than german but fewer than english . [ n 10 ]
when link enters the twilight realm , the void that corrupts parts of hyrule , he transforms into a wolf . [ h ] he is eventually able to transform between his hylian and wolf forms at will . as a wolf , link loses the ability to use his sword , shield , or any secondary items ; he instead attacks by biting , and defends primarily by dodging attacks . however , " wolf link " gains several key advantages in return—he moves faster than he does as a human ( though riding epona is still faster ) and digs holes to create new passages and uncover buried items , and has improved senses , including the ability to follow scent trails . [ i ] he also carries midna , a small imp-like creature who gives him hints , uses an energy field to attack enemies , helps him jump long distances , and eventually allows link to " warp " to any of several preset locations throughout the overworld . [ j ] using link 's wolf senses , the player can see and listen to the wandering spirits of those affected by the twilight , as well as hunt for enemy ghosts named poes . [ k ]
some npos which are particularly well known , often for the charitable or social nature of their activities performed during a long period of time , include amnesty international , oxfam , rotary international , kiwanis international , carnegie corporation of new york , nourishing usa , demira deutsche minenräumer ( german mine clearers ) , fidh international federation for human rights , goodwill industries , united way , acorn ( now defunct ) , habitat for humanity , teach for america , the red cross and red crescent organizations , unesco , ieee , incose , world wide fund for nature , heifer international , translators without borders and sos children 's villages .
the number of pubs in the uk has declined year on year , at least since 1982 . various reasons are put forward for this , such as the failure of some establishments to keep up with customer requirements . others claim the smoking ban of 2007 , intense competition from gastro-pubs , the availability of cheap alcohol in supermarkets or the general economic climate are either to blame , or are factors in the decline . changes in demographics may be an additional factor .
the divisions between all these groups are approximate and their boundaries are not always clear . the mizrahim for example , are a heterogeneous collection of north african , central asian , caucasian , and middle eastern jewish communities that are no closer related to each other than they are to any of the earlier mentioned jewish groups . in modern usage , however , the mizrahim are sometimes termed sephardi due to similar styles of liturgy , despite independent development from sephardim proper . thus , among mizrahim there are egyptian jews , iraqi jews , lebanese jews , kurdish jews , libyan jews , syrian jews , bukharian jews , mountain jews , georgian jews , iranian jews and various others . the teimanim from yemen are sometimes included , although their style of liturgy is unique and they differ in respect to the admixture found among them to that found in mizrahim . in addition , there is a differentiation made between sephardi migrants who established themselves in the middle east and north africa after the expulsion of the jews from spain and portugal in the 1490s and the pre-existing jewish communities in those regions .
the richmond area has many major institutions of higher education , including virginia commonwealth university ( public ) , university of richmond ( private ) , virginia union university ( private ) , virginia college ( private ) , south university - richmond ( private , for-profit ) , union theological seminary & presbyterian school of christian education ( private ) , and the baptist theological seminary in richmond ( btsr—private ) . several community colleges are found in the metro area , including j. sargeant reynolds community college and john tyler community college ( chesterfield county ) . in addition , there are several technical colleges in richmond including itt technical institute , ecpi college of technology and centura college . there are several vocational colleges also , such as fortis college and bryant stratton college .
there is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors— such as intake of processed carbohydrates , total protein , fat , and carbohydrate intake , intake of saturated and trans fatty acids , and low intake of vitamins/minerals—contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance . in any case , analogous to the way modern man-made pollution may possess the potential to overwhelm the environment 's ability to maintain homeostasis , the recent explosive introduction of high glycemic index and processed foods into the human diet may possess the potential to overwhelm the body 's ability to maintain homeostasis and health ( as evidenced by the metabolic syndrome epidemic ) .
some estonians , unwilling to side directly with the nazis , joined the finnish army ( which was allied with the nazis ) to fight against the soviet union . the finnish infantry regiment 200 ( estonian : soomepoisid ) was formed out of estonian volunteers in finland . although many estonians were recruited into the german armed forces ( including estonian waffen-ss ) , the majority of them did so only in 1944 when the threat of a new invasion of estonia by the red army had become imminent . in january 1944 estonia was again facing the prospect of invasion from the red army and the last legitimate prime minister of the republic of estonia ( according to the constitution of the republic of estonia ) delivered a radio address asking all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service . the call resulted in around 38,000 new enlistments and several thousand estonians who had joined the finnish army came back to join the newly formed territorial defense force , assigned to defend estonia against the soviet advance . it was hoped [ by whom ? ] that by engaging in such a war estonia would be able to attract western support for estonian independence .
the romans liked bright colors , and many roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals . the pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion , and it came from the mineral cinnabar , a common ore of mercury . it was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries . the source of cinnabar for the romans was a group of mines near almadén , southwest of madrid , in spain . working in the mines was extremely dangerous , since mercury is highly toxic ; the miners were slaves or prisoners , and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence .
in lithuania propria and in samogitia prior to the creation of the kingdom of lithuania by mindaugas , nobles were named die beste leuten in sources that were written in german language . in the lithuanian language nobles were named ponai . the higher nobility were named 'kunigai ' or 'kunigaikščiai ' ( dukes ) —i.e. , loanword from scandinavic konung . they were the established local leaders and warlords . during the development of the state they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes , and later to the king of lithuania . because of expansion of lithuanian duchy into lands of ruthenia in the mid of 14th century a new term appeared to denominate nobility bajorai—from ruthenian ( modern ukrainian and belarusian languages ) бояре . this word to this day is used in lithuanian language to name nobility , not only for own , but also for nobility of other countries .
china : in china , the torch was first welcomed by politburo standing committee member zhou yongkang and state councilor liu yandong . it was subsequently passed onto cpc general secretary hu jintao . a call to boycott french hypermart carrefour from may 1 began spreading through mobile text messaging and online chat rooms amongst the chinese over the weekend from april 12 , accusing the company 's major shareholder , the lvmh group , of donating funds to the dalai lama . there were also calls to extend the boycott to include french luxury goods and cosmetic products . according to the washington times on april 15 , however , the chinese government was attempting to " calm the situation " through censorship : " all comments posted on popular internet forum sohu.com relating to a boycott of carrefour have been deleted . " chinese protesters organized boycotts of the french-owned retail chain carrefour in major chinese cities including kunming , hefei and wuhan , accusing the french nation of pro-secessionist conspiracy and anti-chinese racism . some burned french flags , some added nazism 's swastika to the french flag , and spread short online messages calling for large protests in front of french consulates and embassy . the carrefour boycott was met with anti-boycott demonstrators who insisted on entering one of the carrefour stores in kunming , only to be blocked by boycotters wielding large chinese flags and hit by water bottles . the bbc reported that hundreds of people demonstrated in beijing , wuhan , hefei , kunming and qingdao .
worldwide consumption of paper has risen by 400 % in the past 40 years leading to increase in deforestation , with 35 % of harvested trees being used for paper manufacture . most paper companies also plant trees to help regrow forests . logging of old growth forests accounts for less than 10 % of wood pulp , but is one of the most controversial issues .
the arena football league ( afl ) is the highest level of professional indoor american football in the united states . it was founded in 1987 by jim foster , making it the third longest-running professional football league in north america , after the canadian football league and the national football league . it is played indoors on a 68-yard field ( about half the distance of an nfl field ) , resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game . the sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by foster , a former executive of the united states football league and the national football league .
until the death of sigismund ii augustus , the last king of the jagiellonian dynasty , monarchs could be elected from within only the royal family . however , starting from 1573 , practically any polish noble or foreigner of royal blood could become a polish–lithuanian monarch . every newly elected king was supposed to sign two documents—the pacta conventa ( " agreed pacts " ) —a confirmation of the king 's pre-election promises , and henrican articles ( artykuły henrykowskie , named after the first freely elected king , henry of valois ) . the latter document served as a virtual polish constitution and contained the basic laws of the commonwealth :
burdened with debt , in 2004 vivendi universal sold 80 % of vivendi universal entertainment ( including the studio and theme parks ) to general electric , parent of nbc . the resulting media super-conglomerate was renamed nbcuniversal , while universal studios inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary . after that deal , ge owned 80 % of nbc universal ; vivendi held the remaining 20 % , with an option to sell its share in 2006 . ge purchased vivendi 's share in nbcu in 2011 and in turn sold 51 % of the company to cable provider comcast . comcast merged the former ge subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets , creating the current nbcuniversal . following federal communications commission ( fcc ) approval , the comcast-ge deal was closed on jan 29 , 2011 . in march 2013 , comcast bought the remaining 49 % of nbcuniversal for $ 16.7 billion .
once in hollywood , the contestants perform individually or in groups in a series of rounds . until season ten , there were usually three rounds of eliminations in hollywood . in the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually . for the next round , the contestants put themselves in small groups and perform a song together . in the final round , the contestants perform solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a band‍—‌depending on the season . in seasons two and three , contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round . in season seven , the group round was eliminated and contestants may , after a first solo performance and on judges approval , skip a second solo round and move directly to the final hollywood round . in season twelve , the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round .
all muslims believe that muhammad had said : " to whomsoever i am mawla , ali is his mawla . " this hadith has been narrated in different ways by many different sources in no less than 45 hadith books [ citation needed ] of both sunni and shia collections . this hadith has also been narrated by the collector of hadiths , al-tirmidhi , 3713 ; [ citation needed ] as well as ibn maajah , 121 ; [ citation needed ] etc . the major point of conflict between the sunni and the shia is in the interpretation of the word 'mawla ' . for the shia the word means 'lord and master ' and has the same elevated significance as when the term had been used to address muhammad himself during his lifetime . thus , when muhammad actually ( by speech ) and physically ( by way of having his closest companions including abu bakr , umar and uthman [ the three future caliphs who had preceded ali as caliph ] publicly accept ali as their lord and master by taking ali 's hand in both of theirs as token of their allegiance to ali ) transferred this title and manner of addressing ali as the mawla for all muslims at ghadiri khum oasis just a few months before his death , the people that came to look upon ali as muhammad 's immediate successor even before muhamamd 's death came to be known as the shia . however , for the sunnis the word simply means the 'beloved ' or the 'revered ' and has no other significance at all .
some bird species undertake shorter migrations , travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food . irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next . this type of migration is normally associated with food availability . species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range , with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics ; others undertake partial migrations , where only a fraction of the population , usually females and subdominant males , migrates . partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions ; in australia , surveys found that 44 % of non-passerine birds and 32 % of passerines were partially migratory . altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions . it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food . some species may also be nomadic , holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability . parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive , irruptive , nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations .
this article covers numbered east-west streets in manhattan , new york city . major streets have their own linked articles ; minor streets are discussed here . the streets do not run exactly east–west , because the grid plan is aligned with the hudson river rather than with the cardinal directions . " west " is approximately 29 degrees north of true west .
other supportive evidence includes : a ≥20 % difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks , a ≥20 % improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol , inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone , or a ≥20 % decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger . testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry , however , and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis . it may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications . it may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations .
up to 1990 , english , german and afrikaans were official languages . long before namibia 's independence from south africa , swapo was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual , choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour south africa ( which granted all 11 of its major languages official status ) , which was seen by them as " a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation . " consequently , swapo instituted english as the sole official language of namibia though only about 3 % of the population speaks it as a home language . its implementation is focused on the civil service , education and the broadcasting system . some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools . it is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools , and " english language " is a compulsory subject . as in other postcolonial african societies , the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low .
the elizabethan navigator , sir francis drake was born in the nearby town of tavistock and was the mayor of plymouth . he was the first englishman to circumnavigate the world and was known by the spanish as el draco meaning " the dragon " after he raided many of their ships . he died of dysentery in 1596 off the coast of puerto rico . in 2002 a mission to recover his body and bring it to plymouth was allowed by the ministry of defence . his cousin and contemporary john hawkins was a plymouth man . painter sir joshua reynolds , founder and first president of the royal academy was born and educated in nearby plympton , now part of plymouth . william cookworthy born in kingsbridge set up his successful porcelain business in the city and was a close friend of john smeaton designer of the eddystone lighthouse . on 26 january 1786 , benjamin robert haydon , an english painter who specialised in grand historical pictures , was born here . the naturalist dr william elford leach frs , who did much to pave the way in britain for charles darwin , was born at hoe gate in 1791 .
southampton city council consists of 48 councillors , 3 for each of the 16 wards . council elections are held in early may for one third of the seats ( one councillor for each ward ) , elected for a four-year term , so there are elections three years out of four . since the 2015 council elections , the composition of the council is :
some critics believe that a clear-text edition gives the edited text too great a prominence , relegating textual variants to appendices that are difficult to use , and suggesting a greater sense of certainty about the established text than it deserves . as shillingsburg notes , " english scholarly editions have tended to use notes at the foot of the text page , indicating , tacitly , a greater modesty about the " established " text and drawing attention more forcibly to at least some of the alternative forms of the text " .
internet services typically provided by isps include internet access , internet transit , domain name registration , web hosting , usenet service , and colocation .
the name ipod was proposed by vinnie chieco , a freelance copywriter , who ( with others ) was called by apple to figure out how to introduce the new player to the public . after chieco saw a prototype , he thought of the movie 2001 : a space odyssey and the phrase " open the pod bay door , hal ! " , which refers to the white eva pods of the discovery one spaceship . chieco saw an analogy to the relationship between the spaceship and the smaller independent pods in the relationship between a personal computer and the music player . apple researched the trademark and found that it was already in use . joseph n. grasso of new jersey had originally listed an " ipod " trademark with the u.s. patent and trademark office ( uspto ) in july 2000 for internet kiosks . the first ipod kiosks had been demonstrated to the public in new jersey in march 1998 , and commercial use began in january 2000 , but had apparently been discontinued by 2001 . the trademark was registered by the uspto in november 2003 , and grasso assigned it to apple computer , inc. in 2005 .
in mathematics , the persian mathematician muhammad ibn musa al-khwarizmi gave his name to the concept of the algorithm , while the term algebra is derived from al-jabr , the beginning of the title of one of his publications . what is now known as arabic numerals originally came from india , but muslim mathematicians did make several refinements to the number system , such as the introduction of decimal point notation . sabian mathematician al-battani ( 850-929 ) contributed to astronomy and mathematics , while persian scholar al-razi contributed to chemistry and medicine .
two polish friends in paris were also to play important roles in chopin 's life there . his fellow student at the warsaw conservatory , julian fontana , had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in england ; albert grzymała , who in paris became a wealthy financier and society figure , often acted as chopin 's adviser and " gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [ his ] life . " fontana was to become , in the words of michałowski and samson , chopin 's " general factotum and copyist " .
some important texts were created and studied by scholars . philosophical works written by yang xiong ( 53 bc – 18 ad ) , huan tan ( 43 bc – 28 ad ) , wang chong ( 27–100 ad ) , and wang fu ( 78–163 ad ) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to dong 's universal order . the records of the grand historian by sima tan ( d. 110 bc ) and his son sima qian ( 145–86 bc ) established the standard model for all of imperial china 's standard histories , such as the book of han written by ban biao ( 3–54 ad ) , his son ban gu ( 32–92 ad ) , and his daughter ban zhao ( 45–116 ad ) . there were dictionaries such as the shuowen jiezi by xu shen ( c. 58 – c. 147 ad ) and the fangyan by yang xiong . biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen . han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre , which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of emperor wu .
in the first world war , devonport was the headquarters of western approaches command until 1941 and sunderland flying boats were operated by the royal australian air force . it was an important embarkation point for us troops for d-day . the city was heavily bombed by the luftwaffe , in a series of 59 raids known as the plymouth blitz . although the dockyards were the principal targets , much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives . this was largely due to plymouth 's status as a major port charles church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the blitz , but has not been demolished , as it is now an official permanent monument to the bombing of plymouth during world war ii .
the ownership of the spectre organisation—originally stylised " spectre " as an acronym of special executive for counter-intelligence , terrorism , revenge and extortion—and its characters , had been at the centre of long-standing litigation starting in 1961 between ian fleming and kevin mcclory over the film rights to the novel thunderball . the dispute began after fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by mcclory and screenwriter jack whittingham—including characters and plot points—into thunderball , which mcclory contested in court , claiming ownership over elements of the novel . in 1963 , fleming settled out of court with mcclory , in an agreement which awarded mcclory the film rights . this enabled him to become a producer for the 1965 film thunderball—with albert r. broccoli and harry saltzman as executive producers—and the non-eon film never say never again , an updated remake of thunderball , in 1983 . [ n 3 ] a second remake , entitled warhead 2000 a.d. , was planned for production and release in the 1990s before being abandoned . under the terms of the 1963 settlement , the literary rights stayed with fleming , allowing the spectre organisation and associated characters to continue appearing in print .
throughout most of his career , athanasius had many detractors . classical scholar timothy barnes relates contemporary allegations against athanasius : from defiling an altar , to selling church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain , and even violence and murder to suppress dissent . athanasius used " arian " to describe both followers of arius , and as a derogatory polemical term for christians who disagreed with his formulation of the trinity . athanasius called many of his opponents " arian " , except for miletus .
in their theoretical rules , the cubist architects expressed the requirement of dynamism , which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it , through a creative idea , so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer . this should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids , cubes and prisms , by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces , mainly triangular , sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units , reminiscent of the so-called diamond cut , or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late gothic architecture . in this way , the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted . the grilles as well as other architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form . thus , new forms of windows and doors were also created , e. g. hexagonal windows . czech cubist architects also designed cubist furniture .
following thein sein 's first ever visit to the uk and a meeting with prime minister david cameron , the myanmar president declared that all of his nation 's political prisoners will be released by the end of 2013 , in addition to a statement of support for the well-being of the rohingya muslim community . in a speech at chatham house , he revealed that " we [ myanmar government ] are reviewing all cases . i guarantee to you that by the end of this year , there will be no prisoners of conscience in myanmar . " , in addition to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the uk and myanmar 's military forces .
after being rendered obsolete by the redesign , the 1895 replica was presented in 1910 to the fa 's long-serving president lord kinnaird . kinnaird died in 1923 , and his family kept it in their possession , out of view , until putting it up for auction in 2005 . it was duly sold at christie 's auction house on 19 may 2005 for £420,000 ( £478,400 including auction fees and taxes ) . the sale price set a new world record for a piece of football memorabilia , surpassing the £254,000 paid for the jules rimet world cup trophy in 1997 . the successful bidder was david gold , the then joint chairman of birmingham city ; claiming the fa and government were doing nothing proactive to ensure the trophy remained in the country , gold stated his purchase was motivated by wanting to save it for the nation . accordingly , gold presented the trophy to the national football museum in preston on 20 april 2006 , where it went on immediate public display . it later moved with the museum to its new location in manchester . in november 2012 , it was ceremonially presented to royal engineers , after they beat wanderers 7–1 in a charity replay of the first fa cup final .
paris is a major international air transport hub with the 4th busiest airport system in the world . the city is served by three commercial international airports : paris-charles de gaulle , paris-orly and beauvais-tillé . together these three airports recorded traffic of 96.5 million passengers in 2014 . there is also one general aviation airport , paris-le bourget , historically the oldest parisian airport and closest to the city centre , which is now used only for private business flights and air shows .
during the cold war , american troops and their allies fought communist forces in korea and vietnam . the korean war began in 1950 , when the soviets walked out of a u.n. security meeting , removing their possible veto . under a united nations umbrella , hundreds of thousands of u.s. troops fought to prevent the takeover of south korea by north korea , and later , to invade the northern nation . after repeated advances and retreats by both sides , and the prc people 's volunteer army 's entry into the war , the korean armistice agreement returned the peninsula to the status quo in 1953 .
the chapter house was built concurrently with the east parts of the abbey under henry iii , between about 1245 and 1253 . it was restored by sir george gilbert scott in 1872 . the entrance is approached from the east cloister walk and includes a double doorway with a large tympanum above .
in the absence of atmospheric oxygen ( o 2 ) , in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from earth atmosphere , hydrogen ( h 2 ) is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons ( h+ ) of the ferrous ( fe2+ ) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the fayalite ( fe 2sio 4 , the olivine iron-endmember ) . the corresponding reaction leading to the formation of magnetite ( fe 3o 4 ) , quartz ( sio 2 ) and hydrogen ( h 2 ) is the following :
the cd was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium . from its origins as a musical format , cds have grown to encompass other applications . in 1983 , following the cd 's introduction , immink and braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd aes convention . in june 1985 , the computer-readable cd-rom ( read-only memory ) and , in 1990 , cd-recordable were introduced , also developed by both sony and philips . recordable cds were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without defects introduced in compression used in other digital recording methods . other newer video formats such as dvd and blu-ray use the same physical geometry as cd , and most dvd and blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio cd .
galicia is further divided into 53 comarcas , 315 municipalities ( 93 in a coruña , 67 in lugo , 92 in ourense , 62 in pontevedra ) and 3,778 parishes . municipalities are divided into parishes , which may be further divided into aldeas ( " hamlets " ) or lugares ( " places " ) . this traditional breakdown into such small areas is unusual when compared to the rest of spain . roughly half of the named population entities of spain are in galicia , which occupies only 5.8 percent of the country 's area . it is estimated that galicia has over a million named places , over 40,000 of them being communities .
15th street starts at fdr drive , and 16th street starts at a dead end half way between fdr drive and avenue c. they are both stopped at avenue c and continue from first avenue to west street , stopped again at union square , and 16th street also pauses at stuyvesant square .
service trials demonstrated another problem however : that ranging and tracking the new high-speed targets was almost impossible . at short range , the apparent target area is relatively large , the trajectory is flat and the time of flight is short , allowing to correct lead by watching the tracers . at long range , the aircraft remains in firing range for a long time , so the necessary calculations can in theory be done by slide rules - though , because small errors in distance cause large errors in shell fall height and detonation time , exact ranging is crucial . for the ranges and speeds that the bofors worked at , neither answer was good enough .
from 1988 to 1997 , the bbc and sky sports had coverage of the fa cup , the bbc had highlights on match of the day and usually one match per round while sky had the same deal . from 1997 to 2001 , itv and sky shared live coverage with both having two matches per round and bbc continuing with highlights on match of the day . from 2002 to 2008 , bbc and sky again shared coverage with bbc having two or three matches per round and sky having one or two . from 2008–09 to 2013–14 , fa cup matches are shown live by itv across england and wales , with utv broadcasting to northern ireland but stv refusing to show them . itv shows 16 fa cup games per season , including the first pick of live matches from each of the first to sixth rounds of the competition , plus one semi-final exclusively live . the final is also shown live on itv . under the same 2008 contract , setanta sports showed three games and one replay in each round from round three to five , two quarter-finals , one semi-final and the final . the channel also broadcast itv 's matches exclusively to scotland , after the itv franchise holder in scotland , stv , decided not to broadcast fa cup games . setanta entered administration in june 2009 and as a result the fa terminated setanta 's deal to broadcast fa-sanctioned competitions and england internationals . as a result of setanta going out of business itv showed the competition exclusively in the 2009–10 season with between three and four matches per round , all quarter finals , semi-finals and final live as the fa could not find a pay tv broadcaster in time . espn bought the competition for the 2010–11 to 2012–13 season and during this time rebecca lowe became the first woman to host the fa cup final in the uk .
feynman had a great deal of success teaching carl , using , for example , discussions about ants and martians as a device for gaining perspective on problems and issues . he was surprised to learn that the same teaching devices were not useful with michelle . mathematics was a common interest for father and son ; they both entered the computer field as consultants and were involved in advancing a new method of using multiple computers to solve complex problems—later known as parallel computing . the jet propulsion laboratory retained feynman as a computational consultant during critical missions . one co-worker characterized feynman as akin to don quixote at his desk , rather than at a computer workstation , ready to do battle with the windmills .
somali people in the horn of africa are divided among different countries ( somalia , djibouti , ethiopia , and northeastern kenya ) that were artificially and some might say arbitrarily partitioned by the former imperial powers . pan-somalism is an ideology that advocates the unification of all ethnic somalis once part of somali empires such as the ajuran empire , the adal sultanate , the gobroon dynasty and the dervish state under one flag and one nation . the siad barre regime actively promoted pan-somalism , which eventually led to the ogaden war between somalia on one side , and ethiopia , cuba and the soviet union on the other .
according to author michael carrithers , while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account , " the outline of the life must be true : birth , maturity , renunciation , search , awakening and liberation , teaching , death . " in writing her biography of the buddha , karen armstrong noted , " it is obviously difficult , therefore , to write a biography of the buddha that meets modern criteria , because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound ... [ but ] we can be reasonably confident siddhatta gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could . " [ dubious – discuss ]
north of central hyderabad lie hussain sagar , tank bund road , rani gunj and the secunderabad railway station . most of the city 's parks and recreational centres , such as sanjeevaiah park , indira park , lumbini park , ntr gardens , the buddha statue and tankbund park are located here . in the northwest part of the city there are upscale residential and commercial areas such as banjara hills , jubilee hills , begumpet , khairatabad and miyapur . the northern end contains industrial areas such as sanathnagar , moosapet , balanagar , patancheru and chanda nagar . the northeast end is dotted with residential areas . in the eastern part of the city lie many defence research centres and ramoji film city . the " cyberabad " area in the southwest and west of the city has grown rapidly since the 1990s . it is home to information technology and bio-pharmaceutical companies and to landmarks such as hyderabad airport , osman sagar , himayath sagar and kasu brahmananda reddy national park .
prior to the rally , seven anti-china protestors were arrested in hanoi after unfurling a banner and shouting " boycott the beijing olympics " through a loudhailer at a market . a vietnamese american was deported for planning protests against the torch , while a prominent blogger , điếu cày ( real name nguyễn văn hải ) , who blogged about protests around the world and who called for demonstrations in vietnam , was arrested on charges of tax evasion . outside vietnam , there were protests by overseas vietnamese in paris , san francisco and canberra . lê minh phiếu , a torchbearer who is a vietnamese law student studying in france , wrote a letter to the president of the international olympic committee protesting china 's " politicisation of the olympics " , citing maps of the torch relay at the official beijing olympic website depicting the disputed islands as chinese territory and posted it on his blog . one day before the relay was to start , the official website appeared to have been updated to remove the disputed islands and dotted lines marking china 's maritime claims in the south china sea .
the third-generation ipod had a weak bass response , as shown in audio tests . the combination of the undersized dc-blocking capacitors and the typical low-impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter , which attenuates the low-frequency bass output . similar capacitors were used in the fourth-generation ipods . the problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance ( line level ) loads , such as an external headphone amplifier . the first-generation ipod shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage , rather than a single capacitor-coupled output , and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load .
the interstate highway system is officially known as the 'dwight d. eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways ' in his honor . it was inspired in part by eisenhower 's own army experiences in world war ii , where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn systems in germany , austria , and switzerland . commemorative signs reading " eisenhower interstate system " and bearing eisenhower 's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and are currently displayed throughout the interstate system . several highways are also named for him , including the eisenhower expressway ( interstate 290 ) near chicago and the eisenhower tunnel on interstate 70 west of denver .
solar energy is radiant light and heat from the sun harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating , photovoltaics , solar thermal energy , solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis .
the discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore ( pitchblende ) by marie curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium , which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials . this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product , since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium . this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry , making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant . besides the pottery glazes , uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use , including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green , yellow , mauve , black , blue , red and other colors .
a particular criticism of the buddha was vedic animal sacrifice . [ web 18 ] he also mocked the vedic " hymn of the cosmic man " . however , the buddha was not anti-vedic , and declared that the veda in its true form was declared by " kashyapa " to certain rishis , who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes . he names the vedic rishis , and declared that the original veda of the rishis [ note 25 ] was altered by a few brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices . the buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true veda that he refused to pay respect to the vedas of his time . however , he did not denounce the union with brahman , [ note 26 ] or the idea of the self uniting with the self . at the same time , the traditional hindu itself gradually underwent profound changes , transforming it into what is recognized as early hinduism .
efforts have been made to protect guam 's coral reef habitats from pollution , eroded silt and overfishing , problems that have led to decreased fish populations . ( since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers , this is important . ) in recent years , the department of agriculture , division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists . before adopting u.s. environmental protection agency standards , portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests . tumon bay has since been made into a preserve . a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit bats .
each congregation has a body of appointed unpaid male elders and ministerial servants . elders maintain general responsibility for congregational governance , setting meeting times , selecting speakers and conducting meetings , directing the public preaching work , and creating " judicial committees " to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases involving sexual misconduct or doctrinal breaches . new elders are appointed by a traveling overseer after recommendation by the existing body of elders . ministerial servants—appointed in a similar manner to elders—fulfill clerical and attendant duties , but may also teach and conduct meetings . witnesses do not use elder as a title to signify a formal clergy-laity division , though elders may employ ecclesiastical privilege such as confession of sins .
as universal 's main product had always been low-budget film , it was one of the last major studios to have a contract with technicolor . the studio did not make use of the three-strip technicolor process until arabian nights ( 1942 ) , starring jon hall and maria montez . the following year , technicolor was also used in universal 's remake of their 1925 horror melodrama , phantom of the opera with claude rains and nelson eddy . with the success of their first two pictures , a regular schedule of high-budget , technicolor films followed .
in 1886 , frank julian sprague invented the first practical dc motor , a non-sparking motor that maintained relatively constant speed under variable loads . other sprague electric inventions about this time greatly improved grid electric distribution ( prior work done while employed by thomas edison ) , allowed power from electric motors to be returned to the electric grid , provided for electric distribution to trolleys via overhead wires and the trolley pole , and provided controls systems for electric operations . this allowed sprague to use electric motors to invent the first electric trolley system in 1887–88 in richmond va , the electric elevator and control system in 1892 , and the electric subway with independently powered centrally controlled cars , which were first installed in 1892 in chicago by the south side elevated railway where it became popularly known as the " l " . sprague 's motor and related inventions led to an explosion of interest and use in electric motors for industry , while almost simultaneously another great inventor was developing its primary competitor , which would become much more widespread . the development of electric motors of acceptable efficiency was delayed for several decades by failure to recognize the extreme importance of a relatively small air gap between rotor and stator . efficient designs have a comparatively small air gap . [ a ] the st. louis motor , long used in classrooms to illustrate motor principles , is extremely inefficient for the same reason , as well as appearing nothing like a modern motor .
cargo and transport aircraft are typically used to deliver troops , weapons and other military equipment by a variety of methods to any area of military operations around the world , usually outside of the commercial flight routes in uncontrolled airspace . the workhorses of the usaf air mobility command are the c-130 hercules , c-17 globemaster iii , and c-5 galaxy . these aircraft are largely defined in terms of their range capability as strategic airlift ( c-5 ) , strategic/tactical ( c-17 ) , and tactical ( c-130 ) airlift to reflect the needs of the land forces they most often support . the cv-22 is used by the air force for the u.s. special operations command ( ussocom ) . it conducts long-range , special operations missions , and is equipped with extra fuel tanks and terrain-following radar . some aircraft serve specialized transportation roles such as executive/embassy support ( c-12 ) , antarctic support ( lc-130h ) , and ussocom support ( c-27j , c-145a , and c-146a ) . the wc-130h aircraft are former weather reconnaissance aircraft , now reverted to the transport mission .
the dutch east india company ( 1800 ) and british east india company ( 1858 ) were dissolved by their respective governments , who took over the direct administration of the colonies . only thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule , although , thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the western powers . colonial rule had a profound effect on southeast asia . while the colonial powers profited much from the region 's vast resources and large market , colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent .
summers are generally warm and sometimes hot . london 's average july high is 24 °c ( 75.2 °f ) . on average london will see 31 days above 25 °c ( 77.0 °f ) each year , and 4.2 days above 30.0 °c ( 86.0 °f ) every year . during the 2003 european heat wave there were 14 consecutive days above 30 °c ( 86.0 °f ) and 2 consecutive days where temperatures reached 38 °c ( 100.4 °f ) , leading to hundreds of heat related deaths . winters are generally cool and damp with little temperature variation . snowfall does occur from time to time , and can cause travel disruption when this happens . spring and autumn are mixed seasons and can be pleasant . as a large city , london has a considerable urban heat island effect , making the centre of london at times 5 °c ( 9 °f ) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts . the effect of this can be seen below when comparing london heathrow , 15 miles west of london , with the london weather centre , in the city centre .
in north america , especially the first half of this period , people experienced considerable prosperity in the roaring twenties . the social and societal upheaval known as the roaring twenties began in north america and spread to europe in the aftermath of world war i . the roaring twenties , often called " the jazz age " , saw an exposition of social , artistic , and cultural dynamism . 'normalcy ' returned to politics , jazz music blossomed , the flapper redefined modern womanhood , art deco peaked . the spirit of the roaring twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity , a break with traditions . everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology . new technologies , especially automobiles , movies and radio proliferated 'modernity ' to a large part of the population . the 1920s saw the general favor of practicality , in architecture as well as in daily life . the 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries , extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations , and significant changes in lifestyle .
although several companies each produce over a billion individually packaged ( known as discrete ) transistors every year , the vast majority of transistors are now produced in integrated circuits ( often shortened to ic , microchips or simply chips ) , along with diodes , resistors , capacitors and other electronic components , to produce complete electronic circuits . a logic gate consists of up to about twenty transistors whereas an advanced microprocessor , as of 2009 , can use as many as 3 billion transistors ( mosfets ) . " about 60 million transistors were built in 2002… for [ each ] man , woman , and child on earth . "
the first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon ( from carbonized paper or bamboo ) . early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter , their electrical resistance decreased . this made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply , since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up , reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further . in the " flashing " process , carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor ( usually gasoline ) . the carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency . a metallized or " graphitized " filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly . this transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament . this also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient , like a metallic conductor , and helped stabilize the lamp 's power consumption , temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage .
according to the somali economic forum , the number of internet users in somalia rose from only 200 in the year 2000 to 106,000 users in 2011 , with the percentage continuing to rise . the number of mobile subscribers is similarly expected to rise from 512,682 in 2008 to around 6.1 million by 2015 .
the consolidation of the " hot ac " format contrasted with the near-demise of most other ac formats : beginning with the 2005-2007 economic downturn and eventual recession most stations went for the more chart-based chr , along with the top 40 , urban and even latino formats . diminishing physical record sales also proved a major blow to the ac genre .
the four main dialectal forms of old english were mercian , northumbrian , kentish , and west saxon . mercian and northumbrian are together referred to as anglian . in terms of geography the northumbrian region lay north of the humber river ; the mercian lay north of the thames and south of the humber river ; west saxon lay south and southwest of the thames ; and the smallest , kentish region lay southeast of the thames , a small corner of england . the kentish region , settled by the jutes from jutland , has the scantiest literary remains .
over 230 works of chopin survive ; some compositions from early childhood have been lost . all his known works involve the piano , and only a few range beyond solo piano music , as either piano concertos , songs or chamber music .
the romans had a greater appreciation for the color green ; it was the color of venus , the goddess of gardens , vegetables and vineyards.the romans made a fine green earth pigment , which was widely used in the wall paintings of pompeii , herculaneum , lyon , vaison-la-romaine , and other roman cities . they also used the pigment verdigris , made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine . by the second century ad , the romans were using green in paintings , mosaics and glass , and there were ten different words in latin for varieties of green .
ethnically and linguistically the population of the republic of the congo is diverse—ethnologue recognises 62 spoken languages in the country—but can be grouped into three categories . the kongo are the largest ethnic group and form roughly half of the population . the most significant subgroups of the kongo are laari in brazzaville and pool regions and vili around pointe-noire and along the atlantic coast . the second largest group are the teke who live to the north of brazzaville with 17 % of the population . boulangui ( m ’ boshi ) live in the northwest and in brazzaville and form 12 % of the population . pygmies make up 2 % of congo 's population .
federal law and treaties , so long as they are in accordance with the constitution , preempt conflicting state and territorial laws in the 50 u.s. states and in the territories . however , the scope of federal preemption is limited because the scope of federal power is not universal . in the dual-sovereign system of american federalism ( actually tripartite because of the presence of indian reservations ) , states are the plenary sovereigns , each with their own constitution , while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority enumerated in the constitution . indeed , states may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights . thus , most u.s. law ( especially the actual " living law " of contract , tort , property , criminal , and family law experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis ) consists primarily of state law , which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next .
dell opened plants in penang , malaysia in 1995 , and in xiamen , china in 1999 . these facilities serve the asian market and assemble 95 % of dell notebooks . dell inc. has invested [ when ? ] an estimated $ 60 million in a new manufacturing unit in chennai , india , to support the sales of its products in the indian subcontinent . indian-made products bear the " made in india " mark . in 2007 the chennai facility had the target of producing 400,000 desktop pcs , and plans envisaged it starting to produce notebook pcs and other products in the second half of 2007 .

described as being " sexy , seductive and provocative " when performing on stage , beyoncé has said that she originally created the alter ego " sasha fierce " to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is . she described sasha as being " too aggressive , too strong , too sassy [ and ] too sexy " , stating , " i 'm not like her in real life at all . " sasha was conceived during the making of " crazy in love " , and beyoncé introduced her with the release of her 2008 album i am ... sasha fierce . in february 2010 , she announced in an interview with allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need sasha fierce . however , beyoncé announced in may 2012 that she would bring her back for her revel presents : beyoncé live shows later that month .
the arts of southeast asia have affinity with the arts of other areas . dance in much of southeast asia includes movement of the hands as well as the feet , to express the dance 's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is going to tell the audience . most of southeast asia introduced dance into their court ; in particular , cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the khmer empire , which was highly influenced by indian hinduism . apsara dance , famous for strong hand and feet movement , is a great example of hindu symbolic dance .
in 1966 the blind beggar in whitechapel became infamous as the scene of a murder committed by gangster ronnie kray . the ten bells is associated with several of the victims of jack the ripper . in 1955 , ruth ellis , the last woman executed in the united kingdom , shot david blakely as he emerged from the magdala in south hill park , hampstead , the bullet holes can still be seen in the walls outside . it is said that vladimir lenin and a young joseph stalin met in the crown and anchor pub ( now known as the crown tavern ) on clerkenwell green when the latter was visiting london in 1903 .
in what was to become a tradition , clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale , and released the song immediately after the season ended . the single , " a moment like this " , went on to break a 38-year-old record held by the beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the billboard hot 100 . guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so . both clarkson and guarini made a musical film , from justin to kelly , which was released in 2003 but was widely panned . clarkson has since become the most successful idol contestant internationally , with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million .
other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference . they suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual 's membership to any group . they argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes , promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities . international epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have " race-specific " treatments . some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice .
beginning in april 1985 , madonna embarked on her first concert tour in north america , the virgin tour , with the beastie boys as her opening act . she progressed from playing cbgb and the mudd club to playing large sporting arenas . at that time she released two more hit singles from the album , " angel " and " dress you up " . in july , penthouse and playboy magazines published a number of nude photos of madonna , taken in new york in 1978 . she had posed for the photographs as she needed money at the time , and was paid as little as $ 25 a session . the publication of the photos caused a media uproar , but madonna remained " unapologetic and defiant " . the photographs were ultimately sold for up to $ 100,000 . she referred to these events at the 1985 outdoor live aid charity concert , saying that she would not take her jacket off because " [ the media ] might hold it against me ten years from now . "
the cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of world war ii , finishing 98–56 . due to the wartime travel restrictions , the first three games of the 1945 world series were played in detroit , where the cubs won two games , including a one-hitter by claude passeau , and the final four were played at wrigley . in game 4 of the series , the curse of the billy goat was allegedly laid upon the cubs when p.k . wrigley ejected billy sianis , who had come to game 4 with two box seat tickets , one for him and one for his goat . they paraded around for a few innings , but wrigley demanded the goat leave the park due to its unpleasant odor . upon his ejection , mr. sianis uttered , " the cubs , they ai n't gon na win no more . " the cubs lost game 4 , lost the series , and have not been back since . it has also been said by many that sianis put a " curse " on the cubs , apparently preventing the team from playing in the world series . after losing the 1945 world series to the detroit tigers , the cubs finished with winning seasons the next two years , but those teams did not enter post-season play .
court presentations of aristocratic young ladies to the monarch took place at the palace from the reign of edward vii . these young women were known as débutantes , and the occasion—termed their " coming out " —represented their first entrée into society . débutantes wore full court dress , with three tall ostrich feathers in their hair . they entered , curtsied , and performed a choreographed backwards walk and a further curtsy , while manoeuvring a dress train of prescribed length . ( the ceremony , known as an evening court , corresponded to the " court drawing rooms " of victoria 's reign . ) after world war ii , the ceremony was replaced by less formal afternoon receptions , usually without choreographed curtsies and court dress .
in the shrinking pc industry , dell continued to lose market share , as it dropped below lenovo in 2011 to fall to number three in the world . dell and fellow american contemporary hewlett packard came under pressure from asian pc manufacturers lenovo , asus , and acer , all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins . in addition , while the asian pc vendors had been improving their quality and design , for instance lenovo 's thinkpad series was winning corporate customers away from dell 's laptops , dell 's customer service and reputation had been slipping . dell remained the second-most profitable pc vendor , as it took 13 percent of operating profits in the pc industry during q4 2012 , behind apple inc. 's macintosh that took 45 percent , seven percent at hewlett packard , six percent at lenovo and asus , and one percent for acer .
queen drew artistic influence from british rock acts of the 1960s and early 1970s , such as the beatles , the kinks , cream , led zeppelin , pink floyd , the who , black sabbath , slade , deep purple , david bowie , genesis and yes , in addition to american guitarist jimi hendrix , with mercury also inspired by the gospel singer aretha franklin . may referred to the beatles as being " our bible in the way they used the studio and they painted pictures and this wonderful instinctive use of harmonies . " at their outset in the early 1970s , queen 's music has been characterised as " led zeppelin meets yes " due to its combination of " acoustic/electric guitar extremes and fantasy-inspired multi-part song epics " .
devonport dockyard is the uk 's only naval base that refits nuclear submarines and the navy estimates that the dockyard generates about 10 % of plymouth 's income . plymouth has the largest cluster of marine and maritime businesses in the south west with 270 firms operating within the sector . other substantial employers include the university with almost 3,000 staff , as well as the tamar science park employing 500 people in 50 companies . several employers have chosen to locate their headquarters in plymouth , including hemsley fraser .
in theory at least , all polish noblemen were social equals . also in theory , they were legal peers . those who held 'real power ' dignities were more privileged but these dignities were not hereditary . those who held honorary dignities were higher in 'ritual ' hierarchy but these dignities were also granted for a lifetime . some tenancies became hereditary and went with both privilege and titles . nobles who were not direct barons of the crown but held land from other lords were only peers " de iure " .
some of chopin 's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles , such as the revolutionary étude ( op . 10 , no . 12 ) , and the minute waltz ( op . 64 , no . 1 ) . however , with the exception of his funeral march , the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number , leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others . there is no evidence to suggest that the revolutionary étude was written with the failed polish uprising against russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time . the funeral march , the third movement of his sonata no . 2 ( op . 35 ) , the one case where he did give a title , was written before the rest of the sonata , but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it .
karl marx published the communist manifesto in february 1848 , with little attention . however , a few days later the french revolution of 1848 broke out , which replaced the monarchy of louis philippe with the second french republic . in june 1848 , paris workers , disenchanted with the new government , built barricades and raised red flags . the new government called in the french army to put down the uprising , the first of many such confrontations between the army and the new worker 's movements in europe .
england is quite a successful nation at the uefa european football championship , having finished in third place in 1968 and reached the semi-final in 1996 . england hosted euro 96 and have appeared in eight uefa european championship finals tournaments , tied for ninth-best . the team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions in 2004 and 2012 . the team 's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980 , 1988 , 1992 and 2000 . the team did not enter in 1960 , and they failed to qualify in 1964 , 1972 , 1976 , 1984 , and 2008 .
in 2002 , chinese geologist chen xuezhong published a seismic risk analysis study in which he came to the conclusion that beginning with 2003 , attention should be paid to the possibility of an earthquake with a magnitude of over 7.0 occurring in sichuan region . he based his study on statistical correlation . that sichuan is a seismically active area has been discussed for years prior to the quake , though few studies point to a specific date and time .
no single feature distinguishes annelids from other invertebrate phyla , but they have a distinctive combination of features . their bodies are long , with segments that are divided externally by shallow ring-like constrictions called annuli and internally by septa ( " partitions " ) at the same points , although in some species the septa are incomplete and in a few cases missing . most of the segments contain the same sets of organs , although sharing a common gut , circulatory system and nervous system makes them inter-dependent . their bodies are covered by a cuticle ( outer covering ) that does not contain cells but is secreted by cells in the skin underneath , is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt – on the other hand arthropods ' cuticles are made of the more rigid α-chitin , and molt until the arthropods reach their full size . most annelids have closed circulatory systems , where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels .
other subjects that lent themselves to visual depiction included the name of battles ( e.g . trafalgar ) , explorers , local notables , discoveries , sporting heroes and members of the royal family . some pub signs are in the form of a pictorial pun or rebus . for example , a pub in crowborough , east sussex called the crow and gate has an image of a crow with gates as wings .
ali was assassinated in 661 by a kharijite partisan . six months later in the same year , in the interest of peace , hasan ibn ali , highly regarded for his wisdom and as a peacemaker , and the second imam for the shias , and the grandson of muhammad , made a peace treaty with muawiyah i . in the hasan-muawiya treaty , hasan ibn ali handed over power to muawiya on the condition that he be just to the people and keep them safe and secure , and after his death he not establish a dynasty . this brought to an end the era of the rightly guided caliphs for the sunnis , and hasan ibn ali was also the last imam for the shias to be a caliph . following this , mu'awiyah broke the conditions of the agreement and began the umayyad dynasty , with its capital in damascus .
the terms used to define greekness have varied throughout history but were never limited or completely identified with membership to a greek state . by western standards , the term greeks has traditionally referred to any native speakers of the greek language , whether mycenaean , byzantine or modern greek . byzantine greeks called themselves romioi and considered themselves the political heirs of rome , but at least by the 12th century a growing number of those educated , deemed themselves the heirs of ancient greece as well , although for most of the greek speakers , " hellene " still meant pagan . on the eve of the fall of constantinople the last emperor urged his soldiers to remember that they were the descendants of greeks and romans .
according to one of her biographers , giles st aubyn , victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life . from july 1832 until just before her death , she kept a detailed journal , which eventually encompassed 122 volumes . after victoria 's death , her youngest daughter , princess beatrice , was appointed her literary executor . beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering victoria 's accession onwards , and burned the originals in the process . despite this destruction , much of the diaries still exist . in addition to beatrice 's edited copy , lord esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before beatrice destroyed them . part of victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by a. c. benson , hector bolitho , george earle buckle , lord esher , roger fulford , and richard hough among others .
chinese media have also reported on jin jing , whom the official chinese torch relay website described as " heroic " and an " angel " , whereas western media initially gave her little mention – despite a chinese claim that " chinese paralympic athlete jin jing has garnered much attention from the media " .
the ratio of muslims to christians fluctuated throughout the period of ottoman domination . in 1777–78 , 47,000 muslims constituted a majority over the island 's 37,000 christians . by 1872 , the population of the island had risen to 144,000 , comprising 44,000 muslims and 100,000 christians . the muslim population included numerous crypto-christians , including the linobambaki , a crypto-catholic community that arose due to religious persecution of the catholic community by the ottoman authorities ; this community would assimilate into the turkish cypriot community during british rule .
while the federal district was ruled by the federal government through an appointed governor , the municipalities within it were autonomous , and this duality of powers created tension between the municipalities and the federal government for more than a century . in 1903 , porfirio díaz largely reduced the powers of the municipalities within the federal district . eventually , in december 1928 , the federal government decided to abolish all the municipalities of the federal district . in place of the municipalities , the federal district was divided into one " central department " and 13 delegaciones ( boroughs ) administered directly by the government of the federal district . the central department was integrated by the former municipalities of mexico city , tacuba , tacubaya and mixcoac .
during his time as an american envoy to france , benjamin franklin , publisher of the old english proverb , " early to bed , and early to rise , makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise " , anonymously published a letter suggesting that parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight . this 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters , rationing candles , and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise . despite common misconception , franklin did not actually propose dst ; 18th-century europe did not even keep precise schedules . however , this soon changed as rail and communication networks came to require a standardization of time unknown in franklin 's day .
patent infringement typically is caused by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder . the scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent . there is safe harbor in many jurisdictions to use a patented invention for research . this safe harbor does not exist in the us unless the research is done for purely philosophical purposes , or in order to gather data in order to prepare an application for regulatory approval of a drug . in general , patent infringement cases are handled under civil law ( e.g. , in the united states ) but several jurisdictions incorporate infringement in criminal law also ( for example , argentina , china , france , japan , russia , south korea ) .
in contrast , joseph smith , the founder of the latter day saint movement , taught : " there is no such thing as immaterial matter . all spirit is matter , but it is more fine or pure , and can only be discerned by purer eyes ; we can not see it ; but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter . " this spirit element has always existed ; it is co-eternal with god . it is also called " intelligence " or " the light of truth " , which like all observable matter " was not created or made , neither indeed can be " . members of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints view the revelations of joseph smith as a restoration of original christian doctrine , which they believe post-apostolic theologians began to corrupt in the centuries after christ . the writings of many [ quantify ] of these theologians indicate a clear influence of greek metaphysical philosophies such as neoplatonism , which characterized divinity as an utterly simple , immaterial , formless , substance/essence ( ousia ) that transcended all that was physical . despite strong opposition from many christians , this metaphysical depiction of god eventually became incorporated into the doctrine of the christian church , displacing the original judeo-christian concept of a physical , corporeal god who created humans in his image and likeness .
around the sixth century ad , a tribe of slavs arrived in a portion of central europe . according to legend they were led by a hero named čech , from whom the word " czech " derives . the ninth century brought the state of great moravia , whose first ruler ( rastislav of moravia ) invited byzantine ruler michael iii to send missionaries in an attempt to reduce the influence of east francia on religious and political life in his country . these missionaries , constantine and methodius , helped to convert the czechs from traditional slavic paganism to christianity and established a church system . they also brought the glagolitic alphabet to the west slavs , whose language was previously unwritten . this language , later known as proto-czech , was beginning to separate from its fellow west slavic hatchlings proto-slovak , proto-polish and proto-sorbian . among other features , proto-czech was marked by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant ( /ɣ/ ) and consistent stress on the first syllable .

in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory , the vacuum is defined as the state ( that is , the solution to the equations of the theory ) with the lowest possible energy ( the ground state of the hilbert space ) . in quantum electrodynamics this vacuum is referred to as 'qed vacuum ' to distinguish it from the vacuum of quantum chromodynamics , denoted as qcd vacuum . qed vacuum is a state with no matter particles ( hence the name ) , and also no photons . as described above , this state is impossible to achieve experimentally . ( even if every matter particle could somehow be removed from a volume , it would be impossible to eliminate all the blackbody photons . ) nonetheless , it provides a good model for realizable vacuum , and agrees with a number of experimental observations as described next .
relations between nasser and king hussein deteriorated in april when hussein implicated nasser in two coup attempts against him—although nasser 's involvement was never established—and dissolved al-nabulsi 's cabinet . nasser subsequently slammed hussein on cairo radio as being " a tool of the imperialists " . relations with king saud also became antagonistic as the latter began to fear that nasser 's increasing popularity in saudi arabia was a genuine threat to the royal family 's survival . despite opposition from the governments of jordan , saudi arabia , iraq , and lebanon , nasser maintained his prestige among their citizens and those of other arab countries .

the infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers . cold , dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars . infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light . stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum , so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected . ( in the visible light spectrum , the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet . )
however , at the state level , the pattern of split ticket voting and divided government holds . democrats currently hold one of the state 's u.s. senate seats , as well as four of the five statewide offices ( governor , superintendent of public instruction , secretary of state and state auditor ) . the lone congressional district has been republican since 1996 and in 2014 steve daines won one of the state 's senate seats for the gop . the legislative branch had split party control between the house and senate most years between 2004 and 2010 , when the mid-term elections returned both branches to republican control . the state senate is , as of 2015 , controlled by the republicans 29 to 21 , and the state house of representatives at 59 to 41 .

on the assumption that intellectual property rights are actual rights stallman argues that this claim does not live to the historical intentions behind these laws , which in the case of copyright served as a censorship system , and later on , a regulatory model for the printing press that may have benefited authors incidentally , but never interfered with the freedom of average readers . still referring to copyright , he cites legal literature such as the united states constitution and case law to demonstrate that it is meant to be an optional and experimental bargain that temporarily trades property rights and free speech for public , not private , benefit in the form of increased artistic production and knowledge . he mentions that " if copyright were a natural right nothing could justify terminating this right after a certain period of time " .
the indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects , projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes . tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive , and later transferred onto walls , floors or craft projects . this method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas , allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front , even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses . mosaic murals , benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method , as it results in a smoother and more even surface .

asphalt/bitumen can sometimes be confused with " coal tar " , which is a visually similar black , thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal . during the early and mid-20th century when town gas was produced , coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates . the addition of tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials . however , since the 1970s , when natural gas succeeded town gas , asphalt/bitumen has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications . other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands , both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar . pitch is another term sometimes used at times to refer to asphalt/bitumen , as in pitch lake .

apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks , inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture ; each son received an equal share of the family property . unlike the practice in later dynasties , the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune . daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries , though this was usually much less than the shares of sons . a different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will , but it is unclear how common this was .
in a switching circuit , the idea is to simulate , as near as possible , the ideal switch having the properties of open circuit when off , short circuit when on , and an instantaneous transition between the two states . parameters are chosen such that the " off " output is limited to leakage currents too small to affect connected circuitry ; the resistance of the transistor in the " on " state is too small to affect circuitry ; and the transition between the two states is fast enough not to have a detrimental effect .
yale and new haven are working to build a medical and biotechnology research hub in the city and greater new haven region , and are succeeding to some extent . [ citation needed ] the city , state and yale together run science park , a large site three blocks northwest of yale 's science hill campus . this multi-block site , approximately bordered by mansfield street , division street , and shelton avenue , is the former home of winchester 's and olin corporation 's 45 large-scale factory buildings . currently , sections of the site are large-scale parking lots or abandoned structures , but there is also a large remodeled and functioning area of buildings ( leased primarily by a private developer ) with numerous yale employees , financial service and biotech companies .
there are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion . the list of goods , services and places available is enormous : from dog perfumes , couture , furniture and housing , to dog groomers , therapists , trainers and caretakers , dog cafes , spas , parks and beaches , and dog hotels , airlines and cemeteries . while dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century , in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking , jumping up , digging , rolling in dung , fighting , and urine marking ( which dogs do to establish territory through scent ) , became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog . dog training books , classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued .
in the iconoclastic era , figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry . the iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the hagia irene in constantinople ( after 740 ) . there were similar crosses in the apses of the hagia sophia church in thessaloniki and in the church of the dormition in nicaea . the crosses were substituted with the image of the theotokos in both churches after the victory of the iconodules ( 787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively , the dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922 ) .
the practice of playing one or two preseason exhibition games by each team before the start of the regular season was discontinued when the nbc contract was initiated , and the regular season was extended from 14 games , the length that it had been since 1996 , to 16 from 2001 to 2010 , and since 2016 . from 2011 to 2015 , the regular season league expanded to 18 games , with each team having two bye weeks and the option of two preseason games .
the linguistic heritage of the british isles is rich , with twelve languages from six groups across four branches of the indo-european family . the insular celtic languages of the goidelic sub-group ( irish , manx and scottish gaelic ) and the brittonic sub-group ( cornish , welsh and breton , spoken in north-western france ) are the only remaining celtic languages—the last of their continental relations becoming extinct before the 7th century . the norman languages of guernésiais , jèrriais and sarkese spoken in the channel islands are similar to french . a cant , called shelta , is spoken by irish travellers , often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group . however , english , sometimes in the form of scots , is the dominant language , with few monoglots remaining in the other languages of the region . the norn language of orkney and shetland became extinct around 1880 .
murdoch has responded to some of the arguments against the newspaper by saying that critics are " snobs " who want to " impose their tastes on everyone else " , while mackenzie claims the same critics are people who , if they ever had a " popular idea " , would have to " go and lie down in a dark room for half an hour " . both have pointed to the huge commercial success of the sun in this period and its establishment as britain 's top-selling newspaper , claiming that they are " giving the public what they want " . this conclusion is disputed by critics . john pilger has said that a late-1970s edition of the daily mirror , which replaced the usual celebrity and domestic political news items with an entire issue devoted to his own front-line reporting of the genocide in pol pot 's cambodia , not only outsold the sun on the day it was issued but became the only edition of the daily mirror to ever sell every single copy issued throughout the country , something never achieved by the sun .
the first phase of eddy street commons , a $ 215 million development located adjacent to the university of notre dame campus and funded by the university , broke ground on june 3 , 2008 . the eddy street commons drew union protests when workers hired by the city of south bend to construct the public parking garage picketed the private work site after a contractor hired non-union workers . the developer , kite realty out of indianapolis , has made agreements with major national chains rather than local businesses , a move that has led to criticism from alumni and students .
proteins are structural materials in much of the animal body ( e.g . muscles , skin , and hair ) . they also form the enzymes that control chemical reactions throughout the body . each protein molecule is composed of amino acids , which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur ( these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein , such as the keratin in hair ) . the body requires amino acids to produce new proteins ( protein retention ) and to replace damaged proteins ( maintenance ) . as there is no protein or amino acid storage provision , amino acids must be present in the diet . excess amino acids are discarded , typically in the urine . for all animals , some amino acids are essential ( an animal can not produce them internally ) and some are non-essential ( the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds ) . about twenty amino acids are found in the human body , and about ten of these are essential and , therefore , must be included in the diet . a diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids ( especially those that are essential ) is particularly important in some situations : during early development and maturation , pregnancy , lactation , or injury ( a burn , for instance ) . a complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids ; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids .
as of december 2015 [ update ] , barcelona has won 23 la liga , 27 copa del rey , 11 supercopa de españa , three copa eva duarte [ note 2 ] and two copa de la liga trophies , as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions . they have also won five uefa champions league , a record four uefa cup winners ' cup , a shared record five uefa super cup and a record three fifa club world cup trophies . they also won a record three inter-cities fairs cup trophies , considered the predecessor to the uefa cup-europa league .
but early in the 16th century , a brilliant new red appeared in europe . when the spanish conquistador hernán cortés and his soldiers conquered the aztec empire in 1519-1521 , they discovered slowly that the aztecs had another treasure beside silver and gold ; they had the tiny cochineal , a parasitic scale insect which lived on cactus plants , which , when dried and crushed , made a magnificent red . the cochineal in mexico was closely related to the kermes varieties of europe , but unlike european kermes , it could be harvested several times a year , and it was ten times stronger than the kermes of poland . it worked particularly well on silk , satin and other luxury textiles . in 1523 cortes sent the first shipment to spain . soon cochineal began to arrive in european ports aboard convoys of spanish galleons .
in his native poland , in france , where he composed most of his works , and beyond , chopin 's music , his status as one of music 's earliest superstars , his association ( if only indirect ) with political insurrection , his love life and his early death have made him , in the public consciousness , a leading symbol of the romantic era . his works remain popular , and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy .
most modern air defence systems are fairly mobile . even the larger systems tend to be mounted on trailers and are designed to be fairly quickly broken down or set up . in the past , this was not always the case . early missile systems were cumbersome and required much infrastructure ; many could not be moved at all . with the diversification of air defence there has been much more emphasis on mobility . most modern systems are usually either self-propelled ( i.e . guns or missiles are mounted on a truck or tracked chassis ) or easily towed . even systems that consist of many components ( transporter/erector/launchers , radars , command posts etc . ) benefit from being mounted on a fleet of vehicles . in general , a fixed system can be identified , attacked and destroyed whereas a mobile system can show up in places where it is not expected . soviet systems especially concentrate on mobility , after the lessons learnt in the vietnam war between the usa and vietnam . for more information on this part of the conflict , see sa-2 guideline .
“ the roots of all our modern academic fields can be found within the pages of literature. ” literature in all its forms can be seen as written records , whether the literature itself be factual or fictional , it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters ’ actions and words or the authors ’ style of writing and the intent behind the words . the plot is for more than just entertainment purposes ; within it lies information about economics , psychology , science , religions , politics , cultures , and social depth . studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history . through the study of past literature we are able to learn about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history . this can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments . not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves , and how they have evolved throughout history ( like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science , for example ) but we can also learn about these things in fictional works . authors often include historical moments in their works , like when lord byron talks about the spanish and the french in ‘ ‘ childe harold ’ s pilgrimage : canto i ’ ’ and expresses his opinions through his character childe harold . through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history . it is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature . information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down . eventually everything was written down , from things like home remedies and cures for illness , or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices . from there people were able to study literature , improve on ideas , further our knowledge , and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started . in much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we continue to evolve and learn more and more .
the argentine , british and chilean claims all overlap , and have caused friction . on 18 december 2012 , the british foreign and commonwealth office named a previously unnamed area queen elizabeth land in tribute to queen elizabeth ii 's diamond jubilee . on 22 december 2012 , the uk ambassador to argentina , john freeman , was summoned to the argentine government as protest against the claim . argentine–uk relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby falkland islands , and the 30th anniversary of the falklands war .
most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex , especially the prefrontal cortex and the parts of the cortex involved in vision . the visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas , with a complex web of interconnections . it has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex . the prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning , working memory , motivation , attention , and executive control . it takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species , and an especially large fraction of the human brain .
society throughout europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the black death . lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned , as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas . although serfdom declined in western europe it became more common in eastern europe , as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free . most peasants in western europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents . the percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period . landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders , and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments . partly at the urging of landlords , governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the black death . non-clergy became increasingly literate , and urban populations began to imitate the nobility 's interest in chivalry .
shift-work or chronic jet-lag have profound consequences on circadian and metabolic events in the body . animals that are forced to eat during their resting period show increased body mass and altered expression of clock and metabolic genes . [ medical citation needed ] in humans , shift-work that favors irregular eating times is associated with altered insulin sensitivity and higher body mass . shift-work also leads to increased metabolic risks for cardio-metabolic syndrome , hypertension , inflammation .
in february 1907 , the royal dutch shell group was created through the amalgamation of two rival companies : the royal dutch petroleum company of the netherlands and the " shell " transport and trading company ltd of the united kingdom . it was a move largely driven by the need to compete globally with standard oil . the royal dutch petroleum company was a dutch company founded in 1890 to develop an oilfield in sumatra , and initially led by august kessler , hugo loudon , and henri deterding . the " shell " transport and trading company ( the quotation marks were part of the legal name ) was a british company , founded in 1897 by marcus samuel , 1st viscount bearsted , and his brother samuel samuel . their father had owned an antique company in houndsditch , london , which expanded in 1833 to import and sell sea-shells , after which the company " shell " took its name .
by the time of the protestant reformation in the 16th century , strasbourg was a prosperous community , and its inhabitants accepted protestantism in 1523 . martin bucer was a prominent protestant reformer in the region . his efforts were countered by the roman catholic habsburgs who tried to eradicate heresy in upper alsace . as a result , alsace was transformed into a mosaic of catholic and protestant territories . on the other hand , mömpelgard ( montbéliard ) to the southwest of alsace , belonging to the counts of württemberg since 1397 , remained a protestant enclave in france until 1793 .
the main party leaders , david cameron , nick clegg and ed miliband , were all depicted holding a copy of the special issue in publicity material . miliband 's decision to pose with a copy of the sun received a strong response . organisations representing the relatives of hillsborough victims described miliband 's action as an " absolute disgrace " and he faced criticism too from liverpool labour mps and the city 's labour mayor , joe anderson . a statement was issued on 13 june explaining that miliband " was promoting england 's bid to win the world cup " , although " he understands the anger that is felt towards the sun over hillsborough by many people in merseyside and he is sorry to those who feel offended . "
the on-again , off-again armistice negotiations continued for two years , first at kaesong , on the border between north and south korea , and then at the neighbouring village of panmunjom . a major , problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war ( pow ) repatriation . the pva , kpa , and un command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many pva and kpa soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north , which was unacceptable to the chinese and north koreans . in the final armistice agreement , signed on 27 july 1953 , a neutral nations repatriation commission , under the chairman indian general k. s. thimayya , was set up to handle the matter .
as a member of the european union , estonia is considered a high-income economy by the world bank . the gdp ( ppp ) per capita of the country , a good indicator of wealth , was in 2015 $ 28,781 according to the imf , between that of slovak republic and lithuania , but below that of other long-time eu members such as italy or spain . the country is ranked 8th in the 2015 index of economic freedom , and the 4th freest economy in europe . because of its rapid growth , estonia has often been described as a baltic tiger beside lithuania and latvia . beginning 1 january 2011 , estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state .
this in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the estado novo under antónio de oliveira salazar in 1933 . portugal was one of only five european countries to remain neutral in world war ii . from the 1940s to the 1960s , portugal was a founding member of nato , oecd and the european free trade association ( efta ) . gradually , new economic development projects and relocation of mainland portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in africa were initiated , with angola and mozambique , as the largest and richest overseas territories , being the main targets of those initiatives . these actions were used to affirm portugal 's status as a transcontinental nation and not as a colonial empire .
the u.s. census bureau reported that in 2000 , 24.0 % of san diego residents were under 18 , and 10.5 % were 65 and over . as of 2011 [ update ] the median age was 35.6 ; more than a quarter of residents were under age 20 and 11 % were over age 65 . millennials ( ages 18 through 34 ) constitute 27.1 % of san diego 's population , the second-highest percentage in a major u.s. city . the san diego county regional planning agency , sandag , provides tables and graphs breaking down the city population into 5-year age groups .
the dominican order was affected by a number of elemental influences . its early members imbued the order with a mysticism and learning . the europeans of the order embraced ecstatic mysticism on a grand scale and looked to a union with the creator . the english dominicans looked for this complete unity as well , but were not so focused on ecstatic experiences . instead , their goal was to emulate the moral life of christ more completely . the dartford nuns were surrounded by all of these legacies , and used them to create something unique . though they are not called mystics , they are known for their piety toward god and their determination to live lives devoted to , and in emulation of , him .
the northern ireland peace process has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the republic of ireland , northern ireland and the united kingdom . for example , citizens of northern ireland are entitled to the choice of irish or british citizenship or both and the governments of ireland and the united kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the northern ireland executive . the northern ireland executive and the government of ireland also meet as the north/south ministerial council to develop policies common across the island of ireland . these arrangements were made following the 1998 good friday agreement .
in april 1950 , stalin gave kim permission to invade the south under the condition that mao would agree to send reinforcements if they became needed . stalin made it clear that soviet forces would not openly engage in combat , to avoid a direct war with the americans . kim met with mao in may 1950 . mao was concerned that the americans would intervene but agreed to support the north korean invasion . china desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the soviets . at that time , the chinese were in the process of demobilizing half of the pla 's 5.6 million soldiers . however , mao sent more ethnic korean pla veterans to korea and promised to move an army closer to the korean border . once mao 's commitment was secured , preparations for war accelerated .
highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak , and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s . the taylor report and premier league regulations obliged arsenal to convert highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season , thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators . this capacity had to be reduced further during champions league matches to accommodate additional advertising boards , so much so that for two seasons , from 1998 to 2000 , arsenal played champions league home matches at wembley , which could house more than 70,000 spectators .
relaxed zoning rules and special parking privileges for churches , the tax-free status of church property , the fact that christmas is a federal holiday , etc. , have also been questioned , but have been considered examples of the governmental prerogative in deciding practical and beneficial arrangements for the society . the national motto " in god we trust " has been challenged as a violation , but the supreme court has ruled that ceremonial deism is not religious in nature . a circuit court ruling affirmed ohio 's right to use as its motto a passage from the bible , " with god , all things are possible " , because it displayed no preference for a particular religion .
the germanic peoples during the migrations period came into contact with other peoples ; in the case of the populations settling in the territory of modern germany , they encountered celts to the south , and balts and slavs towards the east . the limes germanicus was breached in ad 260 . migrating germanic tribes commingled with the local gallo-roman populations in what is now swabia and bavaria . the arrival of the huns in europe resulted in hun conquest of large parts of eastern europe , the huns initially were allies of the roman empire who fought against germanic tribes , but later the huns cooperated with the germanic tribe of the ostrogoths , and large numbers of germans lived within the lands of the hunnic empire of attila . attila had both hunnic and germanic families and prominent germanic chiefs amongst his close entourage in europe . the huns living in germanic territories in eastern europe adopted an east germanic language as their lingua franca . a major part of attila 's army were germans , during the huns ' campaign against the roman empire . after attila 's unexpected death the hunnic empire collapsed with the huns disappearing as a people in europe – who either escaped into asia , or otherwise blended in amongst europeans .
napoléon bonaparte ( /nəˈpoʊliən , -ˈpoʊljən/ ; french : [ napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt ] , born napoleone di buonaparte ; 15 august 1769 – 5 may 1821 ) was a french military and political leader who rose to prominence during the french revolution and led several successful campaigns during the revolutionary wars . as napoleon i , he was emperor of the french from 1804 until 1814 , and again in 1815 . napoleon dominated european and global affairs for more than a decade while leading france against a series of coalitions in the napoleonic wars . he won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles , building a large empire that ruled over continental europe before its final collapse in 1815 . often considered one of the greatest commanders in history , his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide . he also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in western history . in civil affairs , napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered , especially the low countries , switzerland , and large parts of modern italy and germany . he implemented fundamental liberal policies in france and throughout western europe . [ note 1 ] his lasting legal achievement , the napoleonic code , has been adopted in various forms by a quarter of the world 's legal systems , from japan to quebec .
typical fast food dishes include the francesinha ( frenchie ) from porto , and bifanas ( grilled pork ) or prego ( grilled beef ) sandwiches , which are well known around the country . the portuguese art of pastry has its origins in the many medieval catholic monasteries spread widely across the country . these monasteries , using very few ingredients ( mostly almonds , flour , eggs and some liquor ) , managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries , of which pastéis de belém ( or pastéis de nata ) originally from lisbon , and ovos moles from aveiro are examples . portuguese cuisine is very diverse , with different regions having their own traditional dishes . the portuguese have a culture of good food , and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small tasquinhas .
during the development of a tree , the lower limbs often die , but may remain attached for a time , sometimes years . subsequent layers of growth of the attaching stem are no longer intimately joined with the dead limb , but are grown around it . hence , dead branches produce knots which are not attached , and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards .
in its early years of existence , the smooth jazz format was considered to be a form of ac , although it was mainly instrumental , and related a stronger resemblance to the soft ac-styled music . for many years , artists like george benson , kenny g and dave koz had crossover hits that were played on both smooth jazz and soft ac stations .
south indian music and dances such as the kuchipudi and bharatanatyam styles are popular in the deccan region . as a result of their culture policies , north indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the mughals and nizams , and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif ( courtesans ) . these courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture , and were appointed to teach singing , poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy . this gave rise to certain styles of court music , dance and poetry . besides western and indian popular music genres such as filmi music , the residents of hyderabad play city-based marfa music , dholak ke geet ( household songs based on local folklore ) , and qawwali , especially at weddings , festivals and other celebratory events . the state government organises the golconda music and dance festival , the taramati music festival and the premavathi dance festival to further encourage the development of music .
utrecht is well-connected to the dutch road network . two of the most important major roads serve the city of utrecht : the a12 and a2 motorways connect amsterdam , arnhem , the hague and maastricht , as well as belgium and germany . other major motorways in the area are the almere–breda a27 and the utrecht–groningen a28 . due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan , traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around utrecht , causing elevated levels of air pollutants . this has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city 's air quality .
the swingle singers used nonsense words to sound like instruments , but have been known to produce non-verbal versions of musical instruments . like the other groups , examples of their music can be found on youtube . beatboxing , more accurately known as vocal percussion , is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the hip-hop community , where rap is often performed a cappella also . the advent of vocal percussion added new dimensions to the a cappella genre and has become very prevalent in modern arrangements . petra haden used a four-track recorder to produce an a cappella version of the who sell out including the instruments and fake advertisements on her album petra haden sings : the who sell out in 2005 . haden has also released a cappella versions of journey 's " do n't stop believin ' " , the beach boys ' " god only knows " and michael jackson 's " thriller " . in 2009 , toyota commissioned haden to perform three songs for television commercials for the third-generation toyota prius , including an a cappella version of the bellamy brothers ' 1970s song " let your love flow " .

george vi 's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the british empire . the statute of westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the dominions into separate sovereign states . the process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states , known as the commonwealth , gathered pace after the second world war . during the ministry of clement attlee , british india became the two independent dominions of india and pakistan in 1947 . george relinquished the title of emperor of india , and became king of india and king of pakistan instead . in 1950 he ceased to be king of india when it became a republic within the commonwealth of nations , but he remained king of pakistan until his death and india recognised his new title of head of the commonwealth . other countries left the commonwealth , such as burma in january 1948 , palestine ( divided between israel and the arab states ) in may 1948 and the republic of ireland in 1949 .
during the first four days of the war , the general population of the arab world believed arab radio station fabrications of imminent arab victory . on 9 june , nasser appeared on television to inform egypt 's citizens of their country 's defeat . he announced his resignation on television later that day , and ceded all presidential powers to his then-vice president zakaria mohieddin , who had no prior information of this decision and refused to accept the post . hundreds of thousands of sympathizers poured into the streets in mass demonstrations throughout egypt and across the arab world rejecting his resignation , chanting , " we are your soldiers , gamal ! " nasser retracted his decision the next day .

kievan rus ' also played an important genealogical role in european politics . yaroslav the wise , whose stepmother belonged to the macedonian dynasty , the greatest one to rule byzantium , married the only legitimate daughter of the king who christianized sweden . his daughters became queens of hungary , france and norway , his sons married the daughters of a polish king and a byzantine emperor ( not to mention a niece of the pope ) , while his granddaughters were a german empress and ( according to one theory ) the queen of scotland . a grandson married the only daughter of the last anglo-saxon king of england . thus the rurikids were a well-connected royal family of the time .
the earliest known use of the phrase brytish iles in the english language is dated 1577 in a work by john dee . today , this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used . other names used to describe the islands include the anglo-celtic isles , atlantic archipelago , british-irish isles , britain and ireland , uk and ireland , and british isles and ireland . owing to political and national associations with the word british , the government of ireland does not use the term british isles and in documents drawn up jointly between the british and irish governments , the archipelago is referred to simply as " these islands " . nonetheless , british isles is still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago .
the northern mariana islands had become a japanese protectorate before the war . it was the chamorros from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force . the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military . after the war , this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas . guam 's chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them , whereas having been occupied for over 30 years , the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to japan .
this technique was very expensive , though , and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine , distance education , and business meetings . attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video , such as the first systems developed by at & t corporation , first researched in the 1950s , failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques . the greater 1 mhz bandwidth and 6 mbit/s bit rate of the picturephone in the 1970s also did not achieve commercial success , mostly due to its high cost , but also due to a lack of network effect —with only a few hundred picturephones in the world , users had extremely few contacts they could actually call to , and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades .
the si unit of pressure is the pascal ( symbol pa ) , but vacuum is often measured in torrs , named for torricelli , an early italian physicist ( 1608–1647 ) . a torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury ( mmhg ) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure . vacuum is often also measured on the barometric scale or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres . low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury ( mmhg ) or pascals ( pa ) below standard atmospheric pressure . " below atmospheric " means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure .

the english word " translation " derives from the latin translatio ( which itself comes from trans- and from fero , the supine form of which is latum—together meaning " a carrying across " or " a bringing across " ) . the modern romance languages use equivalents of the english term " translation " that are derived from that same latin source or from the alternative latin traducere ( " to lead across " or " to bring across " ) . the slavic and germanic languages ( except in the case of the dutch equivalent , " vertaling " —a " re-language-ing " ) likewise use calques of these latin sources .
