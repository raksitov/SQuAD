The code for Stanford's CS224n ("Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning") default final
project. In this project I am building deep learning system for reading comprehension in Stanford
Question Answering Dataset (SquAD). The code is adapted in part from the
[Neural Language Correction](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/nlc/) code by the Stanford Machine
Learning Group.
